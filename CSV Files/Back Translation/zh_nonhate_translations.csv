57316,"问题就是，在“男的想生女的不想生”的情况下要给男性扣上一个直男癌的帽子我也是不太懂，不是所有想要孩子的男性都是抱着传宗接代的出发点吧,就是即使比如婚前说好了不想要有一方反悔了，那就好聚好散嘛。觉得离婚的女性就受伤害了，我不懂到底是女权还是卑微,就是这个道理！我始终认为女权应该是认为男女平等而不是高于男性一等，和同志平权一样，重点是“平”。女的不想要孩子，那干嘛还要跟一个想要孩子的在一起？我始终觉得要不要孩子是一个很大的问题",0.0,3,"The problem is, I don’t understand why men should be labeled as straight men when “men want to have children but women don’t”. Not all men who want children do so for the purpose of continuing the family line, right? For example, even if you agree before marriage and don't want one party to regret it, then it's better to get together and break up. I feel that divorced women are hurt. I don’t know whether it’s feminism or humbleness. That’s the truth! I always believe that women’s rights should be based on the view that men and women are equal rather than superior to men. Like gay rights, the emphasis is on “equality.” If a woman doesn’t want children, why would she want to be with someone who does? I always feel that whether or not to have children is a big question",问题是，我不明白为什么“男人想要孩子，女人不想要孩子”，男人就应该被贴上直男的标签。并不是所有想要孩子的男人都是为了传宗接代，对吧？比如，即使婚前就同意了，不想让一方后悔，那么，还是复合、分手为好。我觉得离婚的女人受到了伤害。我不知道这是女权主义还是谦虚。这是事实！我始终认为，妇女的权利应该建立在男女平等而不是优于男性的基础上。与同性恋权利一样，重点是“平等”。如果一个女人不想要孩子，她为什么要和一个想要孩子的人在一起呢？我总觉得要不要孩子是个大问题

In fact, this is also the negative impact of pastoral feminism. Some people will take the lead and bring the topic to women's rights = pastoral feminism. This will make men angry and they will not pay attention. Now that we have come to the essence of the problem, we now need to get rid of these long-standing prejudices and misunderstandings, so that more correct gender equality and true feminism can come into people’s view.",我觉得现在的问题是田园女权主义长期压迫男性，导致男性对女权产生偏见。其实，这也是田园女权主义的负面影响。有些人会带头，把话题带到女权=田园女权主义。这会让男人生气，他们不会注意。既然已经触及问题的本质，我们现在就需要摆脱这些长期存在的偏见和误解，让更正确的性别平等和真正的女权主义走进人们的视野。

This really opens the door for parents who don't love their daughters. In Bao Yuming’s case, the right to sexual consent is at the age of 14. Is it okay now? Before the age of 16, you were basically a junior high school student. It is best for our right to sexual consent to be in line with international standards and be changed to 16 to 18 years old to protect it. Our girls.",难怪性同意权在我国是14岁，而在其他国家是16至18岁。这确实为不爱女儿的父母打开了大门。鲍毓明的例子中，同意性行为的权利是14岁，现在可以吗？ 16岁之前，你基本上只是一个初中生。我们的性同意权最好能与国际标准接轨，改为16岁到18岁来保护。我们的女孩们。

57459,同意一部分吧。但是，里面提到的用“爱情”来证明自我存在，然后产生了“生育”-导致仇育仇娃-进而仇女，我觉得是有问题的。清醒的人不需要用所谓的“爱情”证明自我存在，所以起因没了，后面自然不再有。一个依赖“经过男权包装的短暂情感”证明自身的人，让我觉得很奇怪。,0.0,3,"I agree to part of it. However, I think there is a problem with the use of ""love"" to prove self-existence, which then leads to ""fertility"" - leading to hatred of children and then hatred of women. Sober people do not need to use so-called ""love"" to prove their existence, so if the cause is gone, there will naturally be no more. I find it strange that a person relies on ""ephemeral emotions packaged by patriarchy"" to prove himself.",我同意其中的一部分。然而，我认为用“爱”来证明自我存在是有问题的，进而导致“生育”——导致对孩子的仇恨，进而对女性的仇恨。清醒的人不需要用所谓的“爱”来证明自己的存在，所以事业没有了，自然也就没有了。我觉得很奇怪，一个人靠着“父权包装的短暂情感”来证明自己。

Many times, girls are really not protected: they are teased, harassed, molested... In a corner, there may be a girl crying in fear, but they dare not say anything. It’s not just sexual assault that kills victims, it’s society’s attitude toward sexual assault. If the law cannot be improved, why can't public opinion take ""revenge"" on the hypocrites?",是不是一定要侵权才能被注意到？很多时候，女孩真的没有受到保护：她们被戏弄、被骚扰、被猥亵……在某个角落里，可能有一个女孩在害怕地哭泣，但她们却不敢说什么。杀死受害者的不仅仅是性侵犯，还有社会对性侵犯的态度。如果法律不能完善，舆论为何不能对伪善者进行“报复”？

Same-sex marriages It’s not only legal for men to be gay, it’s also legal for women to be gay",但这样一来，被骗结婚或者隐形结婚的同性妻子的权益就没有办法得到保障。而且同性婚姻是合法的，这至少可以让很多同性伴侣拥有自己的婚姻。同性婚姻不仅适用于男同性恋者，也适用于女同性恋者。同性婚姻 不仅男性同性恋合法，女性同性恋也合法

This is certainly not the reason for him to cheat. To be honest, he really has never thought about cheating. It was just an accident. But who gave this accident? Wasn't it given by Anna herself? , remind you again, Wang did not sleep with one woman while comforting another woman. Except for the first accident, he did not sleep with any woman. On the issue of whether to be a scumbag or not, as an idealist and an absolutist, you must have only two outcomes: scumbag or no scumbag. For example, if someone steals 2,000 yuan, steals 20,000 yuan, or steals 20 million yuan, will the legal consequences be the same? , and in the field of love, giving is from both sides. One party keeps giving, and the other only knows to enjoy. This imbalance will sooner or later cause both parties to break up. Of course you will say that this is not the reason why Wang cheated, but do you see clearly? Was he willing to cheat? Did he do it on purpose? Did he do it on purpose? It was all an accident. Since it was an accident, how could you say he was too scumbag? , I want a career, but also want to be accompanied by a good man. Is there such a thing in the world that has the best of both worlds? There are gains and losses, and only idealists will have these thoughts in their hearts. This theory is not just for women, it applies to men as well. No one is perfect, life is life, there is no idealism.",如果只重视事业而不重视伴侣，确实很容易失去伴侣。你已经不再重视对方了，为什么还要要求对方一直重视你呢？当然你会说这不是王某作弊的理由。这当然不是他作弊的理由。说实话，他真的从来没有想过出轨。这只是一次意外。但这起事故是谁造成的呢？这不是安娜自己送的吗？再次提醒大家，王某并没有一边安慰另一名女子，一边与一名女子上床。除了第一次意外，他没有和任何女人睡过。在是否渣男的问题上，作为一个理想主义者和绝对主义者，你必然只有两种结果：渣男或不渣男。比如，有人偷了2000元，偷了2万元，偷了2000万元，法律后果是一样的吗？而在爱情领域，付出是双方的。一方不断付出，另一方只知道享受。这种不平衡迟早会导致双方分手。当然你会说这不是王某作弊的原因，但是你看清楚了吗？他愿意作弊吗？他是故意的吗？他是故意的吗？这一切都是一场意外。既然是意外，怎么能说他太渣呢？ ，我想要一份事业，也想要有一个好男人陪伴。世界上有没有这样一种两全其美的东西？有得有失，只有理想主义者心里才会有这些想法。这个理论不仅适用于女性，也适用于男性。没有人是完美的，生活就是生活，没有理想主义。

For a person with such a long experience in gaming, the first game he mentioned was how inexplicable CEG was.

Because sports competition has political and commercial significance since ancient times, it is a good thing for the development of the country, and it also originated from games. Sports activities originated from games? Is it for people’s leisure and entertainment? It has all been classified as competitive, so of course there is the ordinary entertainment level and the competitive level. E-sports is not simple like traditional sports competition.

Is wcg mainly based on cs and war3? How much do you despise Korean national e-sports? Let me say it again, in that era, could there still be e-sports without SC, saying that CS and War3 are the foundation of e-sports? If you don’t know, just shut up. You don’t play StarCraft. From your own point of view, you don’t comment on games you don’t play. Then how the hell can you confidently say that the influence of CS and War3 player groups at that time was higher than that of SC? ? At that time, Warcraft 3 and Empire Sc were relatively late-comers. Empire 2 received very little sponsorship after 2001 due to the pace of the game, and Microsoft stopped updating it, so it could not be maintained as a competition. Empire Sc Legend CS was overwhelming in Internet cafes. many",以免有人指责我批评我而不提一丝证据，（主要是我真的受不了这篇文章写得累，我就照做了，也没打算写长文来批人/洗地）我就随便说说，开头的那些装模作样的作弊行为和分享家庭背景、游戏经验，让我头疼，从第一场CEG开始就一直放屁，对于一个游戏经验这么长的人来说，他提到的第一场比赛就是CEG，多么莫名其妙。我不想多说了，为什么国家那么打压游戏娱乐，还承认电子竞技？因为体育竞赛自古以来就有政治和商业意义，对国家发展是好事，而且也起源于游戏。体育活动起源于游戏？是为了人们的休闲娱乐吗？都归类为竞技了，所以当然有普通的娱乐级，也有竞技级。电子竞技不像传统体育竞赛那么简单。不是随便玩就能做到的，至于为什么游戏可以随时换人，你不是在胡说八道吗？是你选择了英雄还是英雄选择了你？NBA里有超强碾压型的选手，但他是唯一的选手，如果场上的角色模型实力不一样，谁的影响会更大？持续更新是游戏保持活力的最好方式，不管是从商业角度还是竞技角度。体育竞技以人为本，最终还是要看选手的实力。再说电竞体育，传统体育也是一样，一直有更新，不断扩充。奥运会还起到政治文化的作用，商业链条同样不小。体育本身的国内商业链条也不小，国家队也有广告，你说足球篮球俱乐部都是国家扶持的吗？电竞赛事和商业挂钩不是很正常吗？比赛结果不和商业挂钩不就OK了吗？ ，我懒得学它，去百度复制粘贴一堆运动和比赛的定义，毕竟连三大联赛都是靠百度的截图来解释的，干嘛，用百度百科来增强你的说服力，就怕游戏迷和你一样不知道？，他说他也玩这个玩那个，不玩枪我也不知道，他说09年玩的Dota版本是6.49，原来你玩的这么厉害。jpg 09年的6.61是最耐玩稳定的版本，大家都在09年，你没打到6.61而是6.49？，这更搞笑，你知道wcg是从哪里开始的吗？wcg是不是主要靠cs和war3啊？你是有多鄙视韩国国民电竞？我再说一遍，那个年代，没有SC还能有电子竞技吗，说CS和War3是电子竞技的根基？不知道就闭嘴，你又不玩星际，站在你自己的角度，不评论你不玩的游戏，那你还怎么有自信的说当时CS和War3玩家群体的影响力比SC高？？那时候魔兽争霸3和帝国SC都是比较后来者，帝国2因为节奏太慢在2001年之后很少得到赞助，微软也停止了更新，所以无法作为比赛来维持，帝国SC传奇CS在网吧里铺天盖地，很多

When risks occur, they will definitely affect those around you. What can I say? Because my father has a tendency to violence, and he is the kind of person who can only hear his own voice, and he can't communicate at all. Of course, it is also related to his early experiences. Anyway, they tell their own stories to make me understand them. I have heard them 100 million times since I was a child. In addition, the law does not guarantee the quantification of women's housework and childbirth, and there is no monthly deduction for children that is bound to DNA. So my mother has been somatizing her various worries, anxieties and depression. I am a little cotton-padded jacket and have to bear it. When she is uncomfortable, I hint that everyone in the family will blame me first. I use fists and kitchen knives to attack me. At the same time, I am highly expected by the family. It is a miracle that I can live to this day as a tool. Everyone has their own favorite life state. Housewives who like to stay at home have their own hobbies. There is nothing wrong with reading books and tasting tea, as long as they are down-to-earth. My mother is essentially a home-based woman. Actually, there is nothing wrong with her. It's just that she has no sense of risk and low psychological tolerance. Being laid off has a great impact on her. She can't stay at home as she should, so she is anxious, depressed and somatized. Yes, yes, yes, and there are this-ism and that-ism, bah, in my opinion, there is only one discussion for each issue. I don't care what your ideology is. I only like the ideas I like. Those so-called slogans and isms, from ancient times to the present, hahahahaha! //<username> An anti-Trump march used the name of feminism, and immediately some people in China believed that this was a feminist movement. It's really Ye Gong's love of dragons. Who doesn't have a rebellious mentality? If you want to control others, even if you admit that what you said is part of the truth, who the hell wants to be controlled? If you are, I will rebel against you. Whoever wants to control me, I will rebel against him. Not to mention those who want to use others' influence, which is sinister, I hate the most. Then of course, come and hurt each other! ,Damn it, if someone wants to join the feminist movement, that's their business. I just don't like people who stand on the shoulders of giants and want to twist people's heads off to make them listen to them. Monsters, right? ! They just want to use other people's influence to achieve their own goals. They originally needed to work hard for it, but now they want to use this method, and they can't even notice it themselves. Isn't it terrible? It's just a big devil. ,Of course, I don't agree with all of Wu Zhihong's views. Whose views can completely overlap with anyone else's? Right? Especially his nonsense about the economy. Then I can't kidnap and control him and say you are wrong, I want to twist your head off, right? I see a lot of feminist movements, just learning from him, and then want to twist people's heads off and use people's influence to achieve their own demands. ,It's not that he didn't emphasize freedom, it's true that he was kidnapped by many mothers who essentially like to stay at home. The physical and mental risks of having children and the assessment of occupational risks are things that couples should discuss between themselves. Many women just can't do it in the workplace and don't want to, so what's the problem with them being willing to be husbands? There are men who like this kind of woman, why not? Matching! People say it is an objective law and need of growth. Normally, children go to kindergarten after the age of three. In fact, there are many extroverted children who go to nurseries at the age of one or two. There are many around me. It is also great to read the child's horoscope. On the contrary, it is worth being vigilant if you extend it indefinitely until the child is infinitely old and she has to stay at home. That is her need, not the child's, and has nothing to do with Wu Zhihong.",不管怎样，不客观地评估生活中的风险的后果就是你无法承担任何风险。当风险发生时，肯定会影响到你周围的人。我能说什么？因为我的父亲有暴力倾向，而且他是那种只能听到自己声音的人，根本无法沟通。当然，这也和他早年的经历有关。不管怎样，他们讲述自己的故事让我理解他们。从我还是个孩子的时候起，我已经听过他们一亿遍了。此外，法律并没有保证女性家务劳动和生育的量化，也没有对与DNA绑定的孩子进行每月扣费。所以妈妈一直在躯体化她的各种担忧、焦虑和抑郁。我是一件小棉袄，也得承受。当她不舒服的时候，我暗示家里的每个人都会先责怪我。我用拳头和菜刀攻击我。同时，家人对我也寄予厚望。作为一个工具我能活到今天已经是奇迹了。每个人都有自己喜欢的生活状态。喜欢呆在家里的家庭主妇都有自己的爱好。读书、品茶没有什么错，只要脚踏实地。我的母亲本质上是一个以家庭为基础的妇女。其实，她并没有什么问题。只是她没有风险意识，心理承受能力低。被解雇对她的影响很大。她不能像她应该的那样呆在家里，所以她感到焦虑、抑郁和躯体化。是啊是啊，还有这个主义和那个主义，呸，我觉得每个问题只有一个讨论。我不在乎你的意识形态是什么。我只喜欢我喜欢的想法。那些所谓的口号和主义，从古至今，哈哈哈哈！ //<用户名> 一场反特朗普游行打着女权主义的旗号，立刻就有中国人认为这是一场女权运动。真是叶公对龙的喜爱。谁没有叛逆的心态呢？如果你想控制别人，即使你承认自己说的是部分事实，谁又愿意被控制呢？如果你是，我就会反抗你。谁想控制我，我就反抗他。更何况那些想利用他人影响力的人，那是险恶的，是我最讨厌的。那么当然是来互相伤害啦！ ，妈的，如果有人想加入女权运动，那是他们的事。我只是不喜欢那些站在巨人肩膀上，想把别人的头扭下来让他们听的人。怪物，对吧？ ！他们只是想利用别人的影响力来实现自己的目标。原本需要他们努力去争取，现在想要用这个方法，连他们自己都察觉不到。是不是很可怕？简直就是一个大恶魔啊。 ，当然，我并不同意吴志红的全部观点。谁的观点可以与别人的观点完全重合？正确的？尤其是他对经济的胡言乱语。那我总不能绑架他，控制他，说你错了，我想扭断你的头吧？我看到很多女权运动，就是向他学习，然后想把人的脑袋拧下来，利用人的影响力来达到自己的诉求。 ，不是他不强调自由，确实是被很多本质上喜欢宅在家里的妈妈绑架了。生孩子的身心风险、职业风险评估，是夫妻之间应该讨论的事情。很多女性在职场就是做不到，也不想做，那么她们愿意当丈夫有什么问题呢？这样的女人都有男人喜欢，为什么不呢？匹配！人们说这是客观规律和成长的需要。一般来说，孩子三岁以后就进入幼儿园。事实上，有很多外向的孩子一两岁就去幼儿园了。我周围有很多。阅读孩子的星座也很棒。相反，如果你无限期地延长，直到孩子无限老，她不得不呆在家里，那就值得警惕了。那是她的需要，不是孩子的需要，与吴志红无关。

57700,"另外田园女权之所以是伪女权，就因为她们会搞某某除外，微博有个肖战头像的女权无差别攻击国男，别人问她为啥用肖战头像，她说“肖战是她爱豆，肖战除外”，贴吧女权吧小吧也搞过“如果国男都像蔡徐坤那样优秀我就不会仇视国男了”。证明他们根本就不是女权，说白了就是看颜的明星ncf,女权和田园女权的主要区别有几点：1、对待同一件事是否因为性别关系双标，2、是否打着女权的名义搞性别攻击，鼓动男女站在对立面，3、是否打着女权名义搂钱（某在网上发文看到满大街国男就想呕的，扒拉出以前的微博证明是做妓的，也不知道她那时为啥看到男的不呕，现在发文看到国男就呕还不是为了流量,这个朝木鸦就是个典型的田园女权，下面她还洗起李小璐来了，说什么李小璐出轨就一群人指责他，刘强东出轨一群人心疼，刘强东入狱照片都被网友玩成鬼畜了，还心疼他……",0.0,3,"In addition, the reason why pastoral feminism is pseudo-feminism is because, except for certain people, there is a feminism with Xiao Zhan’s avatar on Weibo that attacks Chinese men indiscriminately. When people asked her why she used Xiao Zhan’s avatar, she said, “Xiao Zhan is the one she loves.” Dou, except Xiao Zhan."" Feminist forums on Tieba and Xiaoba also said, ""If Chinese men were as good as Cai Xukun, I wouldn't hate Chinese men."" It proves that they are not feminist at all. To put it bluntly, they are just celebrity NCF based on looks. The main differences between feminism and pastoral feminism are: 1. Whether the same thing is treated due to double standards of gender relations, 2. Whether gender is engaged in the name of feminism Attack, encourage men and women to stand on opposite sides, 3. Are they trying to get money in the name of women’s rights? (A certain person posted a post on the Internet and felt like vomiting when she saw all the men on the street. She pulled out her old Weibo to prove that she was a prostitute. I didn’t know she was a prostitute at that time. Why don’t I vomit when I see a man? Is it just for the sake of traffic that I’m posting about vomiting when I see a Chinese man? This Chao Muya is a typical pastoral feminist. Next, she also talked about Li Xiaolu. If Li Xiaolu cheated on him, a group of people would accuse him. A group of people felt sorry for Liu Qiangdong's cheating. The photos of Liu Qiangdong in jail were made into ghosts by netizens, and they still felt sorry for him...",另外，田园女权主义之所以是伪女权主义，是因为除了某些人之外，微博上存在着​​一种以肖战头像为对象的女权主义，对中国男性进行肆意攻击。当人们问她为什么用肖战的头像时，她说：“肖战是她爱的人。”豆，除了肖战。”贴吧和小霸的女权论坛也表示，“如果中国男人都像蔡徐坤那么优秀，我就不会讨厌中国男人了。”这证明他们根本不是女权主义者。说白了女权主义和田园女权主义的主要区别在于：1.是否因性别关系的双重标准而对待同一件事，2.性别是否以女权主义的名义进行攻击、鼓励。男人和女人站在对立面，3、是不是打着女权的旗号去捞钱？翻出她的旧微博来证明她是妓女，我当时怎么不知道她是妓女，我发帖只是为了流量吗？看到中国男人就想吐？这个晁慕雅是典型的田园女权主义者。接下来她还谈到了李小璐。如果李小璐出轨，就会有一群人指责他。一群人为刘强东的出轨行为感到惋惜。刘强东入狱照片被网友拍成鬼，还是心疼他……

Even ""hahahaha"" can be an insulting word.",有理由怀疑她不是随便“帮”了那位男医生朋友，没人会帮朋友花十万块钱，可是，朋友为什么就消失了呢？毛毛发微博的时候态度傲慢，态度恶劣，但是问的问题问得很准确，应该是实在找不到法官的理由，所以只能找这么搞笑的。如果毛毛坚持一分钱不付，会不会有第三次开庭？我估计法官们也是无奈又无语了，是啊，那场官司，无聊又有趣。连“哈哈哈哈”都成侮辱词了。

Behavior",<用户名>我特意又看了一遍采访，但没看出什么意思。我认为粉丝们很困惑。面试官让我模仿女朋友的扇子。另一位队友回应道：“这是我女朋友，不是我女朋友的粉丝。”这表明他知道自己在模仿谁。 <用户名> 他正在模仿他女朋友粉丝的行为，而不是他的。行为

58055,管好自己孩子姓什么就好了，管人家孩子干什么，这么在乎自己独立不独立，自己独立有丝分裂生个娃去呀，自己独立带娃去呀,0.0,3,"Just take care of your own child's surname. Don't care what other people's children do. If you care so much about whether you are independent or not, go ahead and have a baby independently.

58057,原来如此，那是我误解了，难怪有公共道德这个表述。 你总不能指望在禁烟区吸烟的人给出什么合理的回答吧，这种情况下基本回的都是火药味的结果，参考价值不高但是能反映一定观念。 不过我还是觉得吸烟人数变多和田园女权没啥关系，一个是田园女权没微博上这么多，二个是没几个人会持续以这个理由抽下去,0.0,3,"I see, that was my misunderstanding. No wonder there is such an expression as public morality. You can't expect people who smoke in no-smoking areas to give reasonable answers. In this case, the answers are basically the result of the smell of gunpowder. The reference value is not high, but it can reflect certain concepts. However, I still think that the increase in the number of smokers has nothing to do with pastoral feminism. One is that pastoral feminism is not as popular on Weibo, and the other is that few people will continue to smoke for this reason.",我明白了，那是我的误会。难怪有公共道德这样的说法。你不能指望在禁烟区吸烟的人给出合理的答案。在这种情况下，答案基本上就是火药味的结果。参考价值不高，但能体现一定的概念。不过，我仍然认为，吸烟人数的增加与田园女权主义无关。一是田园女权主义在微博上不那么流行，二是很少有人会因此而继续抽烟。

58061,16岁的姐姐，孩子一岁了，以贩卖幼女罪，和让幼女X交易罪，让他爹去坐牢。要是警察真的管事，那个牢他爹坐定了。还有那男的要是在20岁以上和她姐姐发生关系未成年的情况下，统统抓去坐牢，那男的的爹妈，以包庇罪，该坐牢的坐牢，该拘留的拘留。中国法律有时候真的是闹着玩,0.0,3,"The 16-year-old sister, whose child is one year old, was charged with trafficking a young girl and letting a young girl have sex, and her father was sent to jail.

The man's parents would be charged with harboring the child, and those who should be jailed would be detained. Chinese law is really a joke sometimes.",这名16岁的妹妹，孩子已经一岁了，被指控拐卖幼女并让幼女发生性关系，她的父亲被送进监狱。如果警察真管了，他父亲肯定会进监狱的。而如果这名男子在她妹妹未成年和20多岁的时候与她发生性关系，他就会被逮捕并入狱。该男子的父母将被指控窝藏孩子，而那些应该入狱的人将被拘留。中国的法律有时候真是一个笑话。

58067,好多人都没弄清楚，法院判无罪只是基于现有的证据，而这类案件本身就缺少可用的证据，更何况时间久远。不过另一个角度看，性骚扰犯一般是惯犯，而目前未发现其他独立指控。只能说这会是一个公案。,0.0,3,"Many people don’t understand that the court’s acquittal is only based on the existing evidence, and this type of case itself lacks available evidence, not to mention that it goes back a long time.

Even if the improvement of the law will take time, can the official express its attention to this matter and indicate that the law will be discussed? Your so-called ""revenge"" is very extreme.

Should the legal community think about whether the low cost of crime caused by the conviction of sexual assault cases condones the behavior of sexual assaulters?",事实上，我认为人们并没有表达出不信任或任何东西。只是这样的运动，如果政府不采取行动，就会引起不信任。所以我不明白❤️🌊他们在某种指示下所做的事情到底在害怕什么。难道舆论过后就不会有“行动”了吗？即使法律的完善需要时间，官方能否表达对此事的重视并表示将讨论该法律？你们所谓的“报复”太极端了。我看到的舆论其实更倾向于希望大家通过这种方式来推动法律的完善。法律界是否应该思考性侵案件定罪带来的低犯罪成本是否纵容了性侵者的行为？

58228,"我之所以跟你在这里说这些，证明我还有良知，如果是那些没有良知的，合不合法关他们什么事，结婚就是了，女孩无辜跟他们有什么关系，结婚有了孩子还是去外面找男人乱交，你有办法吗？我之所以这样说，合法了有良知的同志不会选择再去找女孩，既然法律都允许了父母也就会变得开明一些，你自己想想吧,父母以死相逼，你怎么选择，你不结婚他们就自杀，就是这么极端，我还是坚持最久的，如果今天合法，我今天就可以出柜，遇到合适的同性就结婚，遇不到就养父母终老，等自己老了就去养老院，不拖累任何人，不需要孩子，也不想养孩子，这就是多数同志的心声，不了解这个圈子就不要妄加评论，同志不等于代孕,身边很多被逼婚的同志，如果合法他们都不会选择去伤害一个陌生无辜的女孩，当你真正了解这个圈子，你才会发现有多黑暗，同志婚姻合法了，人才能迈出下一步，不合法就是空谈,至少可以减少很多不是吗，并不是所有人都想要孩子，但没有孩子又和目前的社会现状矛盾，中国老龄化严重，鼓励二胎也是为了多生育，太难了",0.0,3,"The reason why I am telling you this here is to prove that I still have a conscience. If it is those who have no conscience, it is none of their business whether it is legal or not. Just get married. What does it have to do with an innocent girl? If they get married and have children, they should go outside. Do you have any ideas for promiscuity with men? The reason why I say this is that gays with a conscience will not choose to find girls after it is legal. Now that the law allows it, parents will become more open-minded. Think about it for yourself. Your parents are forcing you to die. How do you choose? If they don't get married, they will commit suicide. Even though it is so extreme, I still insist on it the longest. If it were legal today, I could come out today. If I meet a suitable person of the same sex, I will get married. If not, I will support my parents until they grow old. I will go there when I am old. Nursing homes don’t drag anyone down, they don’t need children, and they don’t want to raise children. This is what most gays want. If you don’t understand this circle, don’t make any comments. Being gay does not mean surrogacy. There are many gays around who are forced into marriage. If it is legal, they will not Will choose to hurt a strange and innocent girl. When you truly understand this circle, you will realize how dark it is. Only when gay marriage is legal can people take the next step. If it is not legal, it is just empty talk. At least it can reduce a lot, right? Not everyone wants to have children, but not having children is contradictory to the current social status quo. China is aging seriously. Encouraging second children is also to have more children. It is too difficult.",我之所以在这里告诉你们这些，就是为了证明我还有良知。如果是那些没有良心的人，合法不合法都与他们无关。结婚吧。这和一个单纯的女孩有什么关系？如果他们结婚生子了，就应该出去走走。对于与男人乱交，你有什么想法吗？我之所以这么说，是因为合法之后，有良知的同性恋者不会选择找女孩。现在法律允许了，家长们的思想也会变得更加开放。你自己想想吧。你的父母正在逼你去死。你如何选择？如果不结婚，他们就会自杀。尽管这么极端，我还是坚持得最久。如果今天是合法的，我今天就可以出来。如果我遇到合适的同性，我就会结婚。如果没有，我会赡养我的父母，直到他们变老。当我老的时候我会去那里。疗养院不会拖累任何人，他们不需要孩子，也不想抚养孩子。这是大多数同性恋想要的。如果你不明白这个圈子，就不要发表任何评论。同性恋并不意味着代孕。身边有很多同性恋是被迫结婚的。如果是合法的话，他们不会选择伤害一个陌生而无辜的女孩。当你真正了解这个圈子的时候，你就会知道它有多么黑暗。只有同性婚姻合法，人们才能迈出下一步。如果不合法，那只是一句空话。至少可以减少很多吧？不是每个人都想生孩子，但不生孩子又与现在的社会现状相矛盾。中国老龄化严重。鼓励二胎也是为了多生孩子。太难了。

58290,这人是有病吧。姓氏是历史的产物，现在就算从母姓也是男人的姓。而且最早的姓氏是部落名，也不代表个体。真要这么较真，就自己造个姓吧,0.0,3,"This person must be sick. Surnames are a product of history, and now even the mother's surname is a man's surname. Moreover, the earliest surnames were tribal names and did not represent individuals. If you really want to be so serious, just make up your own name.",这个人一定是有病。姓氏是历史的产物，现在连母亲的姓氏都是男人的姓氏。而且，最早的姓氏是部落的名字，并不代表个人。如果你真想这么认真的话，就自己起个名字吧。

58293,我同意你说的“只计较了自己的生育成本而不顾丈夫的付出”，平等还意味着对两性差异的尊重而不是各方面完全相同。而且我觉得她语气对丈夫“非女权”没那么愤怒，反而更在意的自己“因为不容置疑的女权觉醒而甩了优质丈夫并且对方依旧想打动自己而自己为了大义放弃丈夫孩子”的虐夫人设,0.0,3,"I agree with what you said, ""I only care about my own childbearing costs and ignore my husband's efforts."" Equality also means respecting the differences between the sexes rather than being identical in all aspects. And I think her tone is not so angry at her husband for being ""non-feminist"", but more concerned about her abusive wife situation of ""dumping a good husband because of his undoubted feminist awakening, and the other man still wants to impress her, and she gives up her husband and children for the sake of justice.""",我同意你的说法，“我只关心自己的生育成本，忽略了丈夫的努力”。平等还意味着尊重性别之间的差异，而不是在所有方面都相同。而且我认为她的语气并不是因为丈夫“非女权”而生气，而是更关心她虐待妻子的情况“因为一个好丈夫毫无疑问的女权觉醒而抛弃了他，而另一个男人仍然想给她留下深刻的印象” ，为了正义，她放弃了自己的丈夫和孩子。”
58297,"先从女性提高经济基础开始，其次尊重每个女性的意愿和权益，这是我能做的。,？？？我又被划分到「保护婚姻制度」的阵营了，感觉前面跟您说了那么多您都是「不听不听不听🙉」，您开心就好。加害者是掌握了经济基础优势的男权，不平等的从夫制婚姻制度只是这种霸权下的产物。反对婚姻制度并且把结婚并且追求平等婚姻的女性对立起来，就好像是放任了男性霸权而光抵制霸权产物。,「你结婚，活该你被家暴得妇科病」，和「你穿着暴露，活该被强奸被性骚扰」，您看这逻辑链是否类似？我们应该谴责受害者，先反对上层建筑的不平等；还是应该去谴责加害者，先从经济基础消除不平等呢？,我认为那是她们的自由选择。我个人是婚不婚均可，不必强行把我归类进必婚人士中，给别人贴标签划分阵营我不确定是否是您这类女权主义者的爱好。强迫不想反婚的女性反婚的才是伪女权，本质上和强迫反婚的女性结婚是一致的，这个逻辑也不确定您能否理解。,真正的女权实质应该是平权和维护人权，尊重包括且不局限于任何不想结婚不想生育、想结婚不想生育、想结婚想生育在内的所有权利。反婚反的是以婚恋霸权制造出的不平等婚姻制度，反的是「你必须结婚，不结婚就是怪胎」的谬论，让女性有充分地选择不婚的权利和舆论支持，并不是反个体的结婚行为。",0.0,3,"First, let’s improve women’s economic foundation. Second, respect every woman’s wishes and rights. This is what I can do. ,? ? ? I have been classified into the camp of ""protecting the institution of marriage"" again. I feel that after so many things I told you before, you are ""not listening, not listening, not listening🙉"". Just be happy. The perpetrators are men who have the advantage of economic foundation, and the unequal patriarchal marriage system is just a product of this hegemony. Opposing the institution of marriage and antagonizing women who get married and pursue equal marriage is like allowing male hegemony and only resisting the products of hegemony. , ""You deserve to be domestically abused and get gynecological diseases when you get married"" and ""You deserve to be raped and sexually harassed because of scantily clad clothes"". Do you think these logical chains are similar? Should we blame the victims and fight against inequality in the superstructure first; or should we blame the perpetrators and eliminate inequality from the economic base first? , I think that is their free choice. I personally can be married or not. There is no need to forcefully categorize me into those who must marry. I am not sure whether it is the hobby of feminists like you to label others and divide them into camps. Those who force women who don’t want to resist marriage to resist marriage are pseudo-feminists. It is essentially the same as forcing women who resist marriage to get married. I’m not sure you can understand this logic. The true essence of women's rights should be equal rights and the protection of human rights, and respect for all rights, including but not limited to those who do not want to get married or have children, want to get married but do not want to have children, and want to get married and have children. What is anti-marriage is against the unequal marriage system created by the hegemony of marriage and love. What is against it is the fallacy that ""you must get married, otherwise you are a freak"". Giving women the full right to choose not to marry and the support of public opinion is not against it. Individual marriage behavior.",第一，提高女性的经济基础。第二，尊重每一位女性的意愿和权利。这是我能做的。 、？？？ 我又被归类到“维护婚姻制度”阵营了。感觉之前跟你们说了那么多，你们就是“不听、不听、不听🙉”。开心就好。加害者是拥有经济基础优势的男性，不平等的父权婚姻制度只是这种霸权的产物。反对婚姻制度，对立结婚追求婚姻平等的女性，就等于放任男权，只抵制霸权的产物。 、“结婚就活该被家暴、得妇科病”、“因为衣着暴露就活该被强奸、被性骚扰”。你们觉得这些逻辑链相似吗？是不是应该先怪受害者，再对抗上层建筑的不平等；还是应该先归咎于肇事者，先从经济基础中消除不平等？我觉得那是她们的自由选择，我个人可以结婚也可以不结婚，没必要强行把我归类到必须结婚的人群中。我不确定你们这些女权主义者是不是喜欢给别人贴标签，把他们分成阵营。那些强迫不想抗婚的女性抗婚的人，都是伪女权主义者，本质上和强迫抗婚的女性结婚是一样的。我不确定你们能不能理解这个逻辑。女权的真谛应该是平等权利和人权保障，尊重一切权利，包括但不限于不想结婚生子、想结婚不想生子、想结婚生子的人。反婚姻，就是反对婚恋霸权所造成的不平等婚姻制度，反对的是“必须结婚，否则就是怪胎”的谬论。赋予女性充分的选择不结婚的权利和社会舆论的支持，并不违背个体的婚姻行为。

58299,为什么会觉得同性婚姻合法化是针对男同性恋呢？女同性恋的权利不值得你关注吗？保护女性的权益，不是反对婚姻自由的借口，代孕也不是只有无法产生后代才去做的，很多不愿意自己生育后代的夫妻也会想做的。我觉得用代孕合法化来反对同性合法化实在牵强。,0.0,3,"Why do you think the legalization of same-sex marriage is against gay men? Aren't the rights of lesbians worthy of your attention? Protecting women's rights is not an excuse to oppose freedom of marriage, and surrogacy is not only done by those who cannot have children. Many couples who do not want to have children themselves would also want to do it. I think it is far-fetched to use the legalization of surrogacy to oppose the legalization of same-sex marriage.",为什么你认为同性婚姻合法化对男同性恋者不利？女同性恋者的权利难道不值得你关注吗？保护妇女权利不是反对婚姻自由的借口，代孕也不是只有那些不能生育的人才能做的事。许多自己不想生孩子的夫妇也想生孩子。我认为用代孕合法化来反对同性婚姻合法化是牵强的。

It’s hard to find someone who can’t find it, and only by being honest with the other person can the relationship be steady and smooth. If you hide that you don’t want children or regret it after marriage and want children, then you got married in a muddle-headed way. You don’t understand why you will experience such twists and turns. You decide not to have children before marriage, but many people change their minds after marriage. It depends on how both parties deal with the problem. That’s right, how to raise a child after giving birth is more important.

Even though things have become richer in the past forty years, there has been no progress or even a lot of regression in many aspects, and there are so few original things that it is simply not worth mentioning.",我突然想到一个事实：合成牛胰岛素、青蒿素、哥德巴赫猜想，完整的工业门类和体系，完备的农田水利设施，普及识字和高中教育，全民医疗和医疗卫生机构建设。所有这些都在头三十年内完成。四十年来虽然东西变得更加丰富了，但是很多方面却没有任何进步甚至还有很大的倒退，原创的东西那么少，根本不值得一提。

However, in terms of gender-based attacks, there are obviously more men. China has been a patriarchal society for four to five thousand years. The New China has only been established for only seventy years, and it has not yet been able to adapt to ""real equal rights."" There are many men who think ""thinking"", and some men even cannot understand why women demand equal rights. I think this is quite backward, which is why I support the affirmative movement. I agree with what you said, but it is undeniable that we should learn from history. Most cowards will always remain cowards. The only better way to solve this situation is to use real names. Sadly, we have no way to remind those people’s real friends - those who make malicious comments or deliberately lead topics are malicious, but This is amplified malice. In reality, absolutely, or in other words, very few men dare to scold a woman in front of the public. The Internet is a channel for these people to vent. They scold not only women, but everyone. Things that they dare not criticize in reality are the same for some women. This is human nature.",其实我觉得差不多。不过在性别攻击方面，显然男性更多。中国四五千年来都是男权社会，新中国成立才七十年，至今还没能适应“真正的平权”，很多男性的思维都是“思想化”，有些男性甚至不能理解女性为什么要求平权。我觉得这挺落后的，这也是我支持平权运动的原因。我同意你说的，但不可否认，我们应该从历史中吸取教训。大多数懦夫永远都是懦夫。解决这种情况唯一更好的办法就是实名制。可悲的是，我们没有办法提醒那些人的真正朋友——那些发表恶意评论或故意引导话题的人是恶意的，但这是放大的恶意。现实中，绝对，或者说，很少有男性敢在公众面前骂一个女人。网络是这些人发泄的渠道。他们骂的不只是女人，而是所有人。现实中不敢批评的事情，对于一些女人来说也是一样的，这是人之常情。

This seems to be a common curse used by some Weibo feminists. This makes me very unacceptable and even makes me doubt her own moral character. However, some people say that they are the most sincere.

She has sacrificed a lot to give birth to this child. Many girls like her have given up their studies for the sake of family. In short, she will not treat the child as she stated. I think she may just want to express herself. This is how the point of view is expressed. I just found out today that this is her Weibo. To be honest, I was shocked by her words, and I can’t accept many of her statements. Personally, I don’t like feminist bloggers like Lin Maomao. She seems to be influenced by This kind of enlightenment is so profound that it is almost hysterical. Regarding this result, I respect her choice. She is in good condition after getting out of the marriage. I hope she can make better progress in the future.",在其他评论中，她用“婚姻驴”这个词来侮辱人。这似乎是一些微博女权主义者常用的咒语。这让我非常难以接受，甚至让我怀疑她自己的品德。不过，也有人说，他们是最真诚的。平均主义者在不公平的环境中争取所谓的“平等”，是虚伪的。事实上，她们仍然依赖男性力量。唉，我也需要进步。为了生下这个孩子，她付出了很多。很多像她一样的女孩为了家庭而放弃了学业。总之，她不会像她说的那样对待孩子。我想她可能只是想表达自己。观点是这样表达的。我今天才知道这是她的微博。说实话，我对她的话感到震惊，而且她的很多说法我都无法接受。就我个人而言，我不喜欢林毛毛这样​​的女权博主。她似乎受到了这种感悟的深刻，以至于近乎歇斯底里。对于这个结果，我尊重她的选择。离婚后她的状态很好。希望她以后能够有更好的进步。

Today you say that asking men to buy a house with all the money is called pseudo-feminism. Tomorrow you say that not having children is called pseudo-feminism. Which ""pseudo-feminist"" said that men should bear all the burden of marriage? Post a proof. I will I witnessed it with my own eyes when Sister Bang posted a post last year asking girls if they want men to pay for the entire house price. I have read all the more than 2,000 comments below. I can say that every girl is not necessarily a feminist, and they all said that the entire house price is It’s not safe for men to have sex.

It's a bit like ideally everyone would work together, but in reality, the man may think it's none of my business or something. Instead of being indifferent or expressing opposition, what I am talking about is what should women do better when society does not respond. It is a bit like from a personal point of view. It does not mean that women are like this because they don’t work hard. I will give an inappropriate example to roughly explain it. Poor students take exams. The teacher may think it is cheating, and it will take a long time to take the first and second place every time, so that the students in the class will think that he is not a bad student. Well, I didn’t tell you everything. Compulsory education and family planning are all government-funded Work, for a society that removes the government, slogans should be shouted, but what is more important than slogans is action, or so it means. Women are inevitably discriminated against in work and school because of having children. This can only be solved by the government, because businessmen are profit-seeking and will only use lower costs to get higher returns.",它很难。除非是我感兴趣的热门话题，否则我不想读它或表达我的观点……比如，我对n号房间的事件一无所知。这是严重违反法律的行为。我只是按照法律规定，做我应该做的事。做你想做的事吧。我根本不想多说几句话。你说的太大了。这有点像理想情况下每个人都会一起工作，但实际上，那个人可能会认为这不关我的事什么的。我不是漠不关心，也不是表达反对，而是在社会没有反应的情况下，女性应该做什么更好。从个人角度来说有点像。这并不是说女性因为不努力而变成这样。我举一个不恰当的例子来粗略地解释一下。贫困学生参加考试。老师可能会认为这是作弊，每次都需要很长时间才能获得第一名和第二名，这样班上的学生就会认为他不是一个坏学生。好吧，我没有告诉你一切。义务教育、计划生育都是政府资助的工作，对于一个去掉政府的社会来说，口号是应该喊的，但比口号更重要的是行动，或者说是这个意思。女性因为生孩子而不可避免地在工作和学校受到歧视。这只能由政府来解决，因为商人都是逐利的，只会用更低的成本来获得更高的回报。

59109,其实冠姓权应该在随母姓和随父姓达到五五比的时候才真正说明跟谁姓无所谓，独生女没有家庭继承的困扰，能享受跟儿子一样的待遇，但是大部分非独生家庭女儿继承的财产都比儿子少，只因为以后生的孩子随父姓。姓的源头意义为何女所生，其实姓归根结底是女姓。很多人说随谁无所谓，但孩子随母姓？不行,0.0,3,"In fact, the right to take the surname should only really show that it does not matter whose surname is adopted when the mother's surname and the father's surname reach a ratio of 50 to 50. An only child does not have the trouble of family inheritance and can enjoy the same treatment as a son. However, most daughters from non-only families inherit. His property is less than that of his son, just because the children born in the future will take the father's surname. The original meaning of the surname is that it is born of a woman. In fact, the surname is ultimately a female surname. Many people say it doesn’t matter who you choose, but what about children taking their mother’s surname? no",其实，随姓权应该只是真正说明，当母姓和父姓达到50比50的时候，随谁的姓并不重要。独生子女没有家族继承的麻烦，可以享受和儿子一样的待遇。然而，大多数非独生家庭的女儿都会继承遗产。他的财产比儿子少，只是因为以后生的孩子会随父姓。姓氏的本义是女子所生。事实上，姓氏归根结底是女性姓氏。很多人说选择谁并不重要，但是孩子随母姓呢？不
59110,意思为不管生还是不生，一定问问自己的内心想不想，想生才生，是为自己而生，并且还把责任担起来，不能用生孩子来道德绑架另一半，这和结婚一个道理,0.0,3,"It means that no matter whether you have a child or not, you must ask yourself whether you want to have a child. Give birth only if you want to have a child. It is for yourself and you should take responsibility. You cannot use having a child to morally kidnap your partner. This is the same as getting married.",意思是说，无论有没有孩子，你都要问自己是否想要孩子。仅当您想生孩子时才生孩子。这是为了你自己，你应该承担责任。你不能用生孩子来从道德上绑架你的伴侣。这和结婚是一样的。

59113,政府再吹也没用，现实的代价几乎可以预见，未来孩子的差距会越来越大，“龙生龙凤生凤，老鼠的儿子会打洞”还真没说错。起点就不一样，我家人也是那个不平等年代过来的人，自然看的见政府需要什么，但，相信所谓的和谐，都是在国家机器下的产物，不得已而为之罢了。步伐过快的结果，后果人民承担。,0.0,3,"It is useless for the government to brag. The real cost is almost foreseeable. The gap between children will become wider and wider in the future. ""A dragon will give birth to a dragon and a phoenix will give birth to a phoenix, and the son of a mouse can dig holes."" It is really true. The starting point is different. My family also came from that era of inequality. Naturally, they can see what the government needs. However, I believe that the so-called harmony is a product of the state machine and should be done as a last resort. If the pace is too fast, the people will bear the consequences.",政府吹牛是没有用的。真正的成本几乎是可以预见的。未来孩子之间的差距会越来越大。 “龙生龙，凤生凤，鼠子能挖洞。”这是真的。出发点不同。我的家庭也来自那个不平等的时代。自然，他们能看到政府需要什么。但我认为，所谓和谐是国家机器的产物，应该是不得已而为之。如果步伐太快，后果将由人民承担。

59119,主要是这个事不符合一般走向啊，一般情况下不是应该和解然后发布公告称误会嘛！,0.0,3,"The main thing is that this matter does not conform to the general trend. Under normal circumstances, shouldn’t they reach a settlement and issue an announcement stating that it was a misunderstanding?",最主要的是这件事不符合大势。正常情况下，不应该达成和解，并发布公告，说明这是一场误会吗？

The original version was too Mary Sue-like about falling in love with a superior. Hua Mulan and Elsa are the real princesses of the new era. They are independent, confident, strong and brave, and do not need a prince to save them. Mulan conveys the excellent traditional Chinese culture, the filial piety of joining the army on behalf of one's father, the loyalty and bravery of protecting the family and the country, the power of women who are not inferior to men, and the truly outstanding spiritual core, which is the shining national spirit in traditional culture.",这个适配还是很不错的。原版太玛丽苏式的爱上上级了。花木兰和艾莎是新时代真正的公主。他们独立、自信、坚强、勇敢，不需要王子来拯救他们。花木兰传达了中华优秀传统文化、代父从军的孝道、保家卫国的忠勇、不逊色于男子的女性力量、真正杰出的精神内核，这是传统文化中闪耀的民族精神。

I let my friends fool me.",婚姻中的不忠是肯定的，但是否构成强奸则要看证据。两人之间的实力有着巨大的差距。若是激烈的挣扎，女人的身上就不会有任何痕迹。如果没有斗争，只有口头抵抗，那就没有法律依据。看到女孩的行为，她当时并不想报警。是她那个麻烦的朋友报了警，事情闹大了。现在她要么说自己被强奸了，要么成为邓文迪。她有什么选择呢？我让我的朋友愚弄了我。

In the last century, the survival rate of female babies was good, but the data has gradually increased. Since 1995, at least two female babies have died for every male baby. Aren’t the children born in 1995 modern people? I’m well-intentioned. I said you are not arguing but curious, so I asked you to look for papers on Baidu. You are sarcastic. You are just like that. You didn’t say these words even if you studied population sociology in college. Is 2000 still the last century? We can’t verify the gender of aborted babies, but the serious imbalance in the sex ratio at birth proves that the survival rate of female babies is much lower than that of male babies? There are more data. Please use the search engine. I won’t mention Baidu, okay? It’s funny that you divide the Chinese population according to 1:1 without even understanding the population base. Then don’t you need to consider the aging birth rate? Of course, you should look at the birth rate. You can find relevant papers by yourself. It’s not difficult.

According to the data of China's large-scale population census in 2000, the gender imbalance of infant deaths in the ""one-and-a-half-child"" policy is much higher than that in the ""one-child"" area.

However, after the implementation of family planning, this index reversed the continuous decline over the past 40 years and rose sharply, from 10% after the 1970s to 60% in 1995. Netease News has related reports. In the past, scholars have written papers and conducted investigations on this. Make good use of Baidu...? Don't you know there is a population base issue? Your logic is the same as the 1:1 ratio since the birth of China's first population... Regarding the low survival rate of female babies, large-scale killing of female babies has happened before, but have you heard of killing male babies? These are easy to happen in the old society. In modern society, you can actually see the problem by looking at the male-female ratio of second births. Weibo should be able to search for it. Several regions are extremely unbalanced.",我也希望你能理解这些数据。上个世纪，女婴的存活率还不错，但数据逐渐上升。自1995年以来，每有一个男婴，至少有两个女婴死亡。 1995年出生的孩子不都是现代人吗？我是出于好意。我说你不是争论而是好奇，所以我让你去百度找论文。你很讽刺。你就是这样。即使你在大学里学的是人口社会学，你也不会说这些话。 2000年还是上个世纪吗？我们无法核实流产婴儿的性别，但出生性别比严重失衡，证明女婴的成活率远低于男婴？还有更多数据。请使用搜索引擎。我就不提百度了好吗？可笑的是，你连人口基数都不了解，就按照1：1来划分中国人口。那不需要考虑高龄生育率吗？当然，你应该看看出生率。你可以自行查找相关论文。这并不难。然后就可以查二胎的男女出生率。上世纪堕胎并不流行，大多数只能在出生时溺水身亡。我不是补充说我们可以看看现代社会的二胎吗？你不好奇她是怎么得到数据的，那我就告诉你一个获取数据的方法。什么？你想让我咀嚼你的食物然后喂给你吗？根据2000年中国大规模人口普查数据，“一胎半”政策下婴儿死亡性别失衡远高于“独生子女”地区。 20世纪30年代以来，中国高于正常预期的“超额女婴死亡率”一直在下降。但实行计划生育后，这一指数扭转了40年来持续下降的局面，大幅上升，从20世纪70年代后的10%上升到1995年的60%。网易新闻有相关报道。过去，学者们曾就此撰写论文并进行过调查。用好百度...？难道你不知道人口基数问题吗？你的逻辑和中国第一人口诞生以来1:1的比例是一样的……关于女婴成活率低的问题，大规模杀害女婴的事情以前发生过，但是你听说过杀害男婴吗？这些在旧社会很容易发生。现代社会，其实看二胎的男女比例就可以看出问题。微博应该可以搜索到。一些地区的发展极不平衡。

But if you think about it, isn’t it nonsense? There is no new evidence. How can we try again? Why should we try again just because the social network is not satisfied? What do you think? She said that her friend was not convincing. She should say like others because she believed in the due process. She had already gone to court twice and there was no verdict. But the problem is that the court said that there was insufficient evidence and it could not be counted as an exoneration. So everyone thinks that this does not mean that he is not guilty. It must not have been done. You said you believed in due process. Isn't this nonsense? The court has not completely cleared him up. The people he accused have never questioned whether the court can rule in the wrong direction. If you think your friend has been accused, you can't explain him. Did you do it or not? He insists that he was wronged. Is there anything wrong with you deciding to believe him after knowing him for many years? I don’t know if she has a high emotional intelligence. I don’t know her. I also said that some of her words before were really ill-considered. I just don’t understand why you can’t talk about friends. No one said that you must support your friends unconditionally. But I know more about my friends than you who are not his friends. Is there anything wrong with choosing to believe him after talking to him? What does this have to do with Manson? Those things about Manson are not Rashomon, and they must be compared with Fu Lanlan. It is true that the incident of Woody being accused is much more serious than Fu Lanlan, but Woody does have such a loophole. The nature of Fu Lanlan's alliances is not that serious, but there are many alliances. It is basically certain that he did misconduct and did not run away. Instead, Woody's matter was much more serious in nature. No one except the person involved knew what he did. She didn't do it, and I didn't excuse her. She thinks Woody is a friend and believes her. I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Some people think that Woody just did it after knowing all the information we can learn. I also understand that the truth is that he I still don't know what to think about this matter, and I don't want to take any side. I'm not talking about her acting in that movie. You said she has no emotional intelligence and lacks consideration. I absolutely agree, but the matter of Fu Lanlan is another matter. We all judge based on news reports and the few words that came out, but this person in the same circle has definitely met her. Didn’t she ask him to give her back her pin? I don’t know if Fu Lanlan did anything in front of her, but I don’t think this is a double standard. People judge based on their own experience, maybe because their positions are different. Other actors and Woody basically have a cooperative relationship. Scarlett has been his friend and muse for so many years. How can Scarlett achieve her current status? She is absolutely inseparable from Woody's support. If she gives a more reasonable answer like the Devil and others, that will offend everyone. Since we don't want to draw a clear line and put it on Scarlett, those who think Woody has a problem will ignore it. She would scold her no matter what she said.",起初，我认为他们说如果他们想定罪，就应该再试一次，这是对的。但仔细想想，这不是废话吗？没有新的证据。我们怎样才能再试一次？为什么我们要因为社交网络不满意而再次尝试？你怎么认为？她说她的朋友没有说服力。她应该像其他人一样说，因为她相信正当程序。她已经两次上法庭，但都没有判决。但问题是，法院表示证据不足，不能算无罪。所以大家都认为这并不代表他无罪。它一定没有被完成。你说过你相信正当程序。这不是废话吗？法庭还没有完全澄清他的罪名。他所指控的人从未质疑过法院是否会做出错误的裁决。如果您认为您的朋友被指控，您无法向他解释。你做了还是没做？他坚称自己受到了冤屈。认识他这么多年了，你还决定相信他，这有什么问题吗？不知道她情商高不高。我不认识她。我还说她之前的一些话实在是考虑不周。我只是不明白为什么你不能谈论朋友。没有人说你必须无条件支持你的朋友。但我比你更了解我的朋友，因为你不是他的朋友。和他交谈之后选择相信他有什么错吗？这和曼森有什么关系？曼森的那些东西，不是罗生门，肯定是要和芙兰兰相比的。诚然，伍迪被指控的事件比傅兰兰严重得多，但伍迪确实有这样的漏洞。芙兰兰结盟的性质并没有那么严重，但是结盟的数量却很多。基本可以肯定，他确实有不当行为，并没有逃跑。相反，伍迪的事情本质上要严重得多。除了当事人之外，没有人知道他做了什么。她没有这么做，我也没有原谅她。她认为伍迪是朋友并相信她。我不认为这有什么问题。有些人认为伍迪只是在了解了我们能了解到的所有信息后才这么做的。我也明白，事实是他对于这件事还不知道该怎么想，我也不想选边站。我不是在谈论她在那部电影中的表演。你说她没有情商，缺乏体贴。我绝对同意，但是芙兰兰的事情就是另外一回事了。我们都是根据新闻报道和传出的几句话来判断的，但这个同圈子的人肯定见过她。她不是要求他把密码还给她吗？我不知道傅兰兰在她面前有没有做什么，但我不认为这是双重标准。人们根据自己的经验来判断，也许是因为立场不同。其他演员和伍迪基本上都是合作关系。多年来，斯嘉丽一直是他的朋友和缪斯。斯嘉丽是如何达到现在的地位的呢？她绝对离不开伍迪的支持。如果她像恶魔等人那样给出更合理的答案，那就得罪所有人了。既然我们不想划清界限并把它加在斯嘉丽身上，那些认为伍迪有问题的人就会忽略它。不管她说什么，她都会骂她。

59604,"我说的是男网警和苍井空那事损害警察形象，不知道为什么你会扯到同性荡妇羞辱更厉害，很莫名其妙,她是她，我是我啊,网络上普通网友相互辱骂是常事，辱骂损害的是自己的形象，各地网警披着官皮代表的是警察形象，在其位谋其职，你懂我的意思吧？另外同性更过分你根本没有数据证明，只是你自己的感受,单纯体力搬运工看过数据女性可以占40%，女性建筑业技术工才是少的，说没有女搬运工你是没下过工地吧，另外国家虽然规定女性不能下矿，但实际有很多女矿工但属于黑工没劳动法保障的",0.0,3,"What I’m talking about is that the incident between the male cyber police officer and Sora Aoi has damaged the image of the police. I don’t know why you would bring up the slut-shaming of same-sex women. It’s very inexplicable. She is her and I am me. It is common for ordinary netizens to insult each other on the Internet. Insults damage one's own image. Internet police officers everywhere represent the image of the police in their official attire, and they seek their jobs in their positions. Do you understand what I mean? In addition, homosexuality is more extreme. You have no data to prove it, just your own feelings. I have seen data that women can account for 40% of simple manual porters. There are few female skilled workers in the construction industry. If you say there are no female porters, you have never been to a construction site. Well, in addition, although the country stipulates that women cannot work in the mines, there are actually many female miners who are illegal workers and have no labor law protection.","我说的是，男网警和苍井空的事件损害了警察的形象。我不知道你为什么会提到对同性女性的荡妇羞辱。这是非常令人费解的。她是她，我是我。普通网民在网络上互相辱骂是很常见的事情。侮辱有损自己的形象。各地网络警察以官装代表警察形象，在岗位上谋职。你明白我的意思吗？此外，同性恋现象更为极端。你没有数据证明这一点，只是你自己的感觉。我看过数据，简单手工搬运工中女性可以占到40%。建筑行业的女性技术工人很少。如果你说没有女搬运工，那你就没有去过建筑工地。那么另外呢,虽然国家规定妇女不能到矿山工作,但是实际上有很多女矿工属于非法劳工,没有劳动法的保护。"

If you are willing to hurt innocent people on the way to fight for your legitimate rights and interests, then you can do whatever you like. Anyway, as long as someone is not to your liking, it is bad. I don’t want to deal with unreasonable people like you. No, you are just changing the concept. My core meaning is that there is no problem for women to fight for their legitimate rights and interests, but in the process of fighting for their legitimate rights and interests, innocent people cannot be persecuted. Take Depp for example. From the previous supremacy of men to the supremacy of women, it is nothing more than a role reversal. Discrimination has not changed. What needs to be eliminated is discrimination, not men.",如果你坚持要战斗，那就由你自己决定了。如果你愿意在争取自己合法权益的路上伤害无辜的人，那么你就可以为所欲为了。不管怎样，只要有人不合你的心意，那就不好了。我不想和你这样不讲理的人打交道。不，你只是改变了概念。我的核心意思是，女性争取自己的合法权益没有问题，但是在争取自己合法权益的过程中，无辜的人不能受到迫害。以德普为例。从以前的男性至上，到女性至上，无非是角色反转。歧视没有改变。需要消除的是歧视，而不是男性。

Parents have no choice but to give preference to someone. I didn’t get any support from my family for six or seven years after I graduated, but my younger brother’s family has already bought a house before he graduated. This is an issue of surname rights. To put it simply, property is There is nothing wrong with following the surname, but everyone must discuss it before deciding to take the father's or mother's surname, rather than just taking the father's surname by default.",但现实与法律不同。父母别无选择，只能偏爱某人。我毕业后六七年没有得到家里的任何资助，但弟弟毕业前家里就已经买了房子。这是姓氏权的问题。简单来说，财产随姓并没有什么问题，但是大家一定要商量一下再决定随父姓还是随母姓，而不是就默认随父姓。

Just like the Room N incident, which also caused waves in China, I have seen the picture of the world where surrogacy is allowed and where surrogacy is not explicitly prohibited. I know that only a small number of developing countries in the world are. Even the Nordic countries that recognize equal rights allow surrogacy, which is clearly prohibited. In addition, Taiwan may legalize surrogacy. Of course, this is an issue worthy of urgent concern. Otherwise, when will the critical moment come?",我认为妇女权益与所有女性息息相关，不分国籍。就像N号房事件也在中国掀起波澜一样，我看到过世界上允许代孕和没有明确禁止代孕的图景。我知道世界上只有少数发展中国家是允许代孕的。即使是承认平等权利的北欧国家，也允许代孕，而代孕是明确禁止的。此外，台湾可能会将代孕合法化。当然，这是一个值得迫切关注的问题。否则，关键时刻何时到来？

59616,亚洲文化体系，对女性的压抑，只有中国还算压力轻的。相对比，我国女性真心拒绝，说不的比例还是很大的。这要感谢毛主席对妇女的解放。当然弊端也很多，妇女解放后农村就有很多文化水平低的妇女打骂公婆事件。而在解放前都是婆婆拿捏媳妇儿，媳妇一辈子就为了熬成婆，人生才算熬出头才能过舒坦日子。,0.0,3,"Asian cultural systems suppress women, but only China has relatively light pressure. In comparison, the proportion of Chinese women who sincerely refuse and say no is still very large. This is thanks to Chairman Mao for liberating women. Of course, there are many disadvantages. After women's liberation, there have been many incidents in rural areas of women with low educational levels beating and scolding their parents-in-law. Before liberation, it was the mother-in-law who manipulated the daughter-in-law. The daughter-in-law spent her whole life trying to become a mother-in-law, and only then could she live a comfortable life.",亚洲文化体系压制女性，但只有中国压力相对较小。相比之下，中国女性真心拒绝、说不的比例还是很大的。这都是毛主席解放妇女的功劳。当然，也有很多缺点。妇女解放后，农村低文化妇女打骂公婆的事件时有发生。解放前，是婆婆操纵儿媳妇。儿媳妇一生都在努力成为婆婆，只有这样才能过上舒适的生活。

A 28-year-old woman with good conditions but was married with no children was not retained. She wanted two younger ones. She asked for maternity leave because she was afraid of being recruited.

It also involves his daughter. Wouldn't her daughter feel ashamed to have such a father?",实在不明白有些人的看法！他死了很可惜吗？当那两打受害者听到自杀的消息时，他们会鼓掌吗？他们想要的是法律制裁，而他却因害怕犯罪而自杀，让受害者永远得不到法律的道歉。他们说他死了很遗憾？这也涉及到他的女儿。她的女儿有这样的父亲，难道不会感到羞耻吗？

As long as outstanding women continue to get to the core through their personal abilities, and although it is difficult but they can reach it, and they can make decisions on their own, it will naturally improve the overall environment for women. But 2. The core of the gender issue is still a class issue. I saw women joining the group online, but in reality it is always divided into classes, but the fact is often like this. It is too difficult to get back the ""land"" that belongs to you. Once the shadow of fighting for it appears. The ugly ones will be picked out by the ""landlords"" and set up as models. After a violent fight to occupy the moral high ground, before the gentle and rational ""peasants"" can react, the half acre of land they just came to is gone. To change this situation, either the ""landowners"" themselves will completely collapse and give the other party a chance; or the ""peasants"" will come up with a wise man, or both",但我觉得女权其实并不需要组织（如果我们想改变现阶段的现状）。 1因为这是一个比例问题。只要优秀女性继续通过个人能力深入核心，虽然困难但能达到，并能自己做决定，自然会改善女性的整体环境。但2.性别问题的核心仍然是阶级问题。我在网上看到有女性进群，但现实中总是分班的，但事实往往是这样的。想要拿回属于自己的“土地”太难了。一旦出现争夺的影子。丑的会被“地主”挑出来当模特。经过一场暴力争夺道德制高点后，还没等温柔理性的“农民”反应过来，他们刚刚来到的半亩地就已经没了。要改变这种局面，要么“地主”自己彻底崩溃，给对方机会；或者“农民”会想出一个智者，或者两者兼而有之

I have also met a man who married into a child and the woman changed her surname to the woman's surname (the son also has the woman's surname). To put it bluntly, being strong is the last word. Nowadays, it is said online. What’s the point of other people’s housework?",如果你真的关心姓氏权，想要争取平等权利，那么重点不在于姓氏权，而在于女人自身的经济实力是否强大或者至少与男人持平。只有这样，才有讨论的余地。我有两个同学和姐妹，一个随父姓，一个随母姓。我也遇到过一个男的，结婚生了孩子，女方改姓女方的（儿子也随女方的姓氏）。说白了，坚强才是硬道理。现在网上也有这样的说法。别人家务活有什么意义？

As women, shouldn't we bless her instead of scolding her for abandoning the group? If she expresses pain, as women, isn't it our job to help and encourage her? What is the difference between this behavior of blaming married and pregnant women as donkeys and the feudal society's behavior of pointing out that unmarried and infertile women are unfilial and unvirtuous? The latter is the patriarchal society identifying women as reproductive machines, and the former is identifying women as eternal ""independent"" individuals. Both do not respect women's personal ideas and are just objectification of women. She chooses, she decides, she is happy, isn't that the real right thing? But at least true feminism will not stand on the opposite side of other women who are in a disadvantaged position, and will not point fingers at other women. ,To be honest, it is important to fight for the right to bear a surname.

59979,"不就是在争吗？连话都不让说，还争什么啊？女的只能围着厨房转是刻板印象，孩子大部分跟父姓也是刻板印象啊，都要争取都要改啊,所以我觉得，喊出来要求正视冠姓权的人是勇士，是没错的啊。过去我们改变不了，从现在一点点争取，一点点改变，努力工作、尽量不被糟糕的婚姻束缚，也是所有女性的诉求啊。从自己做起，呼吁周围人一起，也没错啊,确实每个人都有选择放弃或争取的权利，但是我十几岁时见到周围很多女人打女胎，骨子里很害怕的，感觉恐惧，不止是对女婴的残害，还是对母体的残害。请允许一些女性呐喊，哪怕不那么悦耳，因为不是所有人都有一样的生活条件，也因为这片土地，埋了太多女婴的冤魂,有人开疆拓土，有人撰写史书，有能力帮助更多人，或是站出来说出不平等现象，让后来人避开坑，都是在为一件事努力的。如果没有发声的人，又有多少人知道，法律规定孩子就是可以随父姓可以随母姓，而不是默认只能随父姓？起码我以前也认为，周围都跟父姓啊，从没见过跟母姓的。我觉得有人发声挺好的～,男的批评女权就罢了，因为动了他们的蛋糕，女的也批评我就想不通，女权本子也是在帮全体女性。噢，你是幸福的，不用帮，但总是有樊胜美那样的，有招弟、盼弟、念弟那样的。起码能唤醒一个是一个，能帮一个是一个,何不食肉糜，你要是睁眼看看几千万女婴连命都没有，无数女性因被家暴，但没地方容下她们，只能继续和施暴者一起生活，就会知道，偏激的女权本意还是保护女性的。我身边见过40多岁的大姐，打胎五六个女婴，你能说她不幸福吗？她是自愿的，可是如果不是大环境，她又怎么会糟践自己身子，虐杀自己孩子？",0.0,3,"Isn't it just a fight? If you are not even allowed to talk, what are you fighting for? It is a stereotype that women can only stay in the kitchen, and it is also a stereotype that most children take their father's surname. We must fight for it and change it. So I think those who shout out and demand to face up to the right to take the surname are warriors, and it is right. We can't change the past, but from now on, we should fight for it little by little, change it little by little, work hard, and try not to be bound by a bad marriage. This is also the appeal of all women. It is not wrong to start with yourself and call on people around you to join. It is true that everyone has the right to choose to give up or fight for it, but when I was a teenager, I saw many women around me aborting female fetuses. I was very scared in my bones. I felt terrified. It was not only a harm to the baby girl, but also a harm to the mother. Please allow some women to shout, even if it is not so pleasant, because not everyone has the same living conditions, and because this land has buried too many innocent souls of baby girls. Some people open up new territories, some write history books, have the ability to help more people, or stand up to speak out about inequality so that later generations can avoid pitfalls. They are all working for one thing. If no one speaks up, how many people will know that the law stipulates that children can take the father's surname or the mother's surname, rather than the default that they can only take the father's surname? At least I used to think so, everyone around me took the father's surname, and I never saw anyone taking the mother's surname. I think it's good that someone speaks up~, it's fine if men criticize feminism because it touches their cake, but I don't understand why women also criticize me, the feminist book is also to help all women. Oh, you are happy, you don't need to help, but there are always people like Fan Shengmei, Zhaodi, Pandi, and Niandi. At least if you can wake up one person, it's one person, and if you can help one person, it's one person, why not eat meat porridge, if you open your eyes and see that tens of millions of baby girls don't even have a life, countless women have been abused by their families, but there is no place to accommodate them, and they can only continue to live with the abusers, you will know that the radical feminism is still intended to protect women. I have seen a 40-year-old lady around me who aborted five or six baby girls. Can you say she is not happy? She is voluntary, but if it weren't for the general environment, how could she ruin her body and abuse her own children?",不就是打架吗？如果连说话都不让你，那你还争什么？女人只能呆在厨房里是一种刻板印象，大多数孩子随父姓也是一种刻板印象。我们必须为之奋斗并改变它。所以我认为那些大声疾呼、要求正视姓氏权利的人都是勇士，这是对的。过去的我们无法改变，但从现在开始，我们应该一点一点地争取，一点一点地改变，努力工作，尽量不要被不好的婚姻所束缚。这也是所有女性的诉求。从自己做起，号召身边的人加入，并没有错。诚然，每个人都有选择放弃或争取的权利，但当我十几岁的时候，我看到周围有很多女性堕胎。我从骨子里非常害怕。我感到害怕。这不仅是对女婴的伤害，也是对母亲的伤害。请允许一些女人大声喊叫，即使不那么愉快，因为不是每个人都有同样的生活条件，因为这片土地埋葬了太多无辜的女婴灵魂。有些人开辟了新的疆土，有些人写了历史书，有能力帮助更多的人，或者站出来为不平等发声，让后人避免陷入困境。他们都在为一件事而努力。如果没有人发声，有多少人会知道，法律规定孩子可以随父姓，也可以随母姓，而不是默认只能随父姓？至少我以前是这么认为的，我身边的人都随父姓，从来没有见过有人随母姓。我觉得有人发声是件好事~，男人批评女权主义也没关系，因为触及到了他们的蛋糕，但我不明白为什么女人也批评我，女权书也是为了帮助所有女性。呵呵，你开心就好，不用帮忙，但总有像樊胜美、招娣、潘娣、念娣这样的人。起码能叫醒一个人就是一个人，能帮助一个人就是一个人，何不吃肉粥呢，睁开眼一看，千万女婴连有生活，无数女性被家人虐待，却没有地方容纳，只能继续和施虐者一起生活，你就会知道，激进的女权主义仍然是为了保护女性。我见过身边有一位40多岁的女士，流产过五六个女婴。你能说她不幸福吗？她是自愿的，但如果不是大环境，她怎么可能毁掉自己的身体，虐待自己的孩子呢？

I don't think they even have this right. Besides, abortion is painful and few women are willing to endure it.

It is necessary to standardize and rationally use police equipment, and it will only become more and more standardized in the future. This is a trend. You are right. There are many police officers who die or are injured in the line of duty every year, and many of them are young police officers. Therefore, there is a greater need for equipment and weapons to arm the police and reduce casualties, rather than relying on physical bodies. What did your leaders emphasize after the police casualties were proficient in the use of police equipment? Or do we need the police to strengthen their training and use their bodies to deal with criminals? Sanda training in the police academy is actually about strengthening the body, but in reality, most of them cannot be used. In addition, even if men have an advantage in physical strength compared to women, they may not face criminals in society. They all have to rely on equipment, crowd tactics, and weapons. If the other party uses fists, the police can use batons and pepper spray. If the other party uses a knife, they can grab them. This standardized handling method can reduce the casualties of police officers, and the same is true for female police officers.",这并不是因为领导者害怕承担责任。警用装备要标准化、合理使用，未来只会越来越标准化。这是一个趋势。你是对的。每年都有不少警察因公殉职或受伤，其中不少是年轻警察。因此，更需要装备和武器来武装警察、减少伤亡，而不是依靠肉体。在民警伤亡人员熟练使用警械后，你们领导强调了什么？还是需要警察加强训练，用身体去对付犯罪分子？警校的散打训练，其实是为了强身健体，但现实中，大部分都用不了。另外，即使男性相比女性在体力上有优势，但在社会上也未必会面对犯罪分子。他们都必须依靠装备、人群战术和武器。如果对方使用拳头，警察可以使用警棍和胡椒喷雾。如果对方用刀的话，他们就可以抢到。这种标准化的处理方式可以减少警务人员的伤亡，对于女警务人员来说也是如此。

She couldn't take jokes, had low emotional intelligence, was immature, was unwilling to dedicate herself to art, and was unwilling to do anything. If you work hard on your acting skills, etc., not only may you lose the job, but the director will also add fuel to the chatter and jokes in the circle by saying that the actor is unprofessional, not committed, and ignorant, etc. It won’t take much effort for a newcomer like Huang to these directors, right?",这些人是不是想至少在口头上占小女孩的便宜？如果当时女孩表现出厌恶的话，就会受到批评。她听不懂笑话，情商低，不成熟，不愿意献身于艺术，也不愿意做任何事情。如果在演技等方面下功夫，不仅可能丢掉工作，导演还会说演员不专业、不敬业、无知等，给圈里的闲聊、笑话火上浇油。像黄这样的新人对于这些导演来说不会花费太多的努力吧？

60171,我记得他承认了的。所以只是因为没证据无法让他接受制裁，而不是他没有触犯法律。韩国用语无嫌疑=没证据，无法证明做没做。,0.0,3,"I remember him admitting it.

The Korean term ""no suspicion"" means no evidence, unable to prove whether something was done or not.",我记得他承认过。所以只是因为没有证据表明他不能接受制裁，并不是说他没有违法。韩语中的“无嫌疑”是指没有证据，无法证明某件事是否做了。

It's pitiful to be scolded by the WA editor for baseless remarks and things. Can you understand this logic? , read the original text yourself, he donated money, he donated money, where did he say he regretted it? Then when WA said that he publicly said he regretted cooperating and publicly criticized him, wasn't that just editing? Isn’t it pitiful to be edited? If you point to the facts and say that he is siding with others by donating money, the fans will have no objection at all. Of course I can't stand it if you add fuel to the fire and base your remarks on nothing. Comments with pictures, if you have to struggle, I think it is ""No matter what TC thinks in his heart, he originally just wanted to remain silent (that is his right) but he is chased by the media every day and forced to take sides, otherwise it means that he supports pedophilia. . In the end, we chose a more neutral approach and did not criticize WA, which is a very decent public relations behavior. However, it was really pitiful that the director would be criticized for making a false statement two years later.” The problem was that everyone was forcing the young actors who had worked with them to express their opinions. The young actors had no human rights. The director doesn't need to be careful about what he says and does, but editing things that others haven't said is very Kim Kardashian-like. Obviously I have never publicly said that I regret cooperating.",被WA骂并不可怜。被WA编辑骂毫无根据的言论和事情，真是可怜。你能理解这个逻辑吗？ ，你自己看原文吧，他捐了钱，他捐了钱，他哪里说后悔了？那么当WA说他公开表示后悔合作并公开批评他时，这不就是剪辑吗？被编辑不是很可怜吗？如果你指出事实，说他捐钱是站在别人一边，粉丝们根本不会反对。当然，如果你火上浇油、无中生有的话，我是受不了的。带图评论，如果非要挣扎的话，我想就是“不管TC心里怎么想，他本来只是想保持沉默（那是他的权利），却天天被媒体追着逼着走”双方，否则就说明他支持恋童癖，最后我们选择了比较中立的态度，没有批评WA，这是很正派的公关行为，但是导演却被批评了，实在是太可怜了。两年后的虚假陈述。”问题是大家都在强迫和他们合作的年轻演员表达自己的意见，年轻演员没有人权，导演不需要小心自己的言行，却剪辑别人没有的东西。显然我从来没有公开说过我后悔合作。

Who knows, and no matter how radical feminist rights are, they should not focus on a specific person. First of all From an outsider's point of view, we can only see that Papi's child followed his father's will, and cannot know the reason why Papi made this choice, so it is not right to say that he has lost this right. And radical feminism can work hard to make the system stipulate that the mother's surname should be taken, and they can even work hard to abolish the marriage system, but they cannot directly scold women who get married under the current system.

Men Being sexually harassed is basically power harassment and not based on gender discrimination. In fact, male compatriots are also harmed by gender discrimination. But why women are so sensitive to this kind of thing is mainly because it is very common and women are under the dual pressure of power and gender in this environment. Porn culture is still mainly based on women. I don’t deny that many men also have the same pressure, but women have received more restrictions due to gender discrimination. I personally think this is a social problem. Many girls who yearn for these careers are not aware of themselves at all. Used as props. If the entire industry is not coercive and not patriarchal, those who can follow their own wishes are free choices. The current situation is these rules based on the principle of inequality between men and women. If women do not follow them, they will be marginalized or eliminated.",是的，我能理解对艺人爆红行为的怀疑，但这种行为有更多正面的影响，虽然很表面。1.对正在发生的其他性骚扰行为造成了公众压力。2.同时也让更多女性有机会对性别问题发声和反思。男性被性骚扰基本都是权力骚扰，并不是基于性别歧视。其实男性同胞也受到性别歧视的伤害。但为什么女性对这种事情这么敏感，主要是因为它很常见，女性在这种环境下承受着权力和性别的双重压力。色情文化还是以女性为主。我不否认很多男性也有同样的压力，但女性因为性别歧视受到了更多的限制，我个人觉得这是一个社会问题，很多向往这些职业的女孩，完全没有意识到自己被当成了道具。如果整个行业不是强制的，不是男权的，那些能按照自己意愿做事的人，都是自由的选择。现在的情况是这些规则建立在男女不平等的原则上，如果女性不遵守，就会被边缘化或被淘汰。

It is indeed unethical for Woody Allen to marry his adopted daughter, but he has not sexually assaulted any woman in the workplace, and the accusation of sexually assaulting his adopted daughter Dylan is also full of doubts (how could it be possible to sexually assault someone with such a close relationship) It only happened once and it was not at home?).

You are mentally sentenced to death.",是的，烟草比酒精更严重。酒精实际上更严重。一些抗抑郁药物还含有大麻甚至鸦片的某些成分。因此，一些精神类药物也需要谨慎，一不小心就会上瘾。这个世界充满了漏洞，很难全部描述出来。但最可怕的是利用网络舆论来剥夺违法者的某些权利，即使对方已经承担了全部法律责任。你在精神上被判了死刑。

60336,说实话，我根本不觉得这算什么事，我可以预想，将来我被某个女性伤害过深，可能有一段时间我也会说出一些讨厌女性的极端的话来发泄，难道这就是男权。而且现在的成果本人完全没有所谓的“女权”倾向，爱五剧组中那么多男性，她有说很讨厌谁了吗，所以你的某些评论纯属是在无中生有。,0.0,3,"To be honest, I don’t think this is anything at all. I can predict that in the future, if I am deeply hurt by a certain woman, I may say some extreme words that hate women to vent my anger. Is this male supremacy? Moreover, it turns out that I have no so-called ""feminist"" tendencies at all. There are so many men in the Aiwu crew. Did she say she hates any of them? So some of your comments are purely unfounded.",说实话，我觉得这根本就不算什么。我可以预见，将来如果我被某个女人深深伤害，我可能会说出一些仇视女性的极端话语来发泄我的愤怒。这是男权主义吗？而且，事实证明我根本没有所谓的“女权主义”倾向。爱舞剧组里那么多男人，她有说过她恨他们中的任何一个吗？所以你的一些言论纯粹是无稽之谈。

60342,大部分中国男人买房子都是家里人掏钱的，因为男人生的孩子跟家里姓，给家里传宗接代，如果男女一起掏钱买房，男人也上班，女人也上班。而且女人十月怀胎生孩子工作也耽误了，身体也损伤了，孩子跟女方姓理所当然。中国人非常重视孩子的冠姓权，这是隐形的财产继承权,0.0,3,"When most Chinese men buy a house, their family members pay for it, because the children born by a man bear the family name and carry on the family lineage. If men and women buy a house together, the man will also work, and the woman will also work. Moreover, the woman was delayed in her work during the ten-month pregnancy and gave birth to the child, and her body was also damaged. It was natural for the child to bear the woman's surname. Chinese people attach great importance to the right of their children to have surnames, which is an invisible inheritance right of property.",大多数中国男人买房时，都是由家人买单，因为男人生的孩子有姓氏，可以传承家族血统。如果男女一起买房，男方也工作，女方也工作。而且，该女子在怀孕十个月期间耽误了工作，生下孩子，身体也受到了损害。孩子随女姓是理所当然的事。中国人非常重视子女的姓氏权，这是一种无形的财产继承权。

Is it a hospital? No, my personal thought is that I am disappointed with my loved ones and helpless. What you said is just for people who say that wind is like rain. I agree with the attitude of the owner. The hospital has the responsibility. It originally described the proof in a strong direction. It is true. No, it’s also wrong to have poor supervision, but have you ever thought that family members shouldn’t be at the forefront of public opinion?

Should doctors be asked to judge the mother's tolerance limit?",至于你描述的跳楼者涉嫌他杀或者过失杀人的问题，我只是道听途说。濒临绝望、想自杀的人，在没有人理解的情况下，会觉得窗台算不了什么。到底发生了什么，只有当事人自己知道，所以我们不用担心。您想要尸检还是常规程序？你要明白，母亲走上这条路是多么的绝望。这是医院吗？不，我个人的想法是对亲人的失望和无奈。你所说的只是针对那些说风如雨的人。我同意楼主的态度。医院有责任。它最初以强有力的方向描述了证明。是真的。不，监管不力也是不对的，但你有没有想过，家人不应该站在舆论的最前沿？母亲曾多次日夜与家人沟通。难道他们没有实现母亲的愿望吗？是否应该请医生判断母亲的耐受限度？

I found the report of the major American media in five minutes. If you don't ask for verification, you don't know the facts. Then why are you defending your brother? Comments and pictures , didn’t he say before that he couldn’t condemn wa because of the contract and then he was ripped off? Isn’t that a lie? He told metoo that wa had contract restrictions and wa said that public relations don’t allow wallflowers to cheat on both sides.",你太年轻了，对吧？其他柴勒梅的粉丝没有一个敢反驳这一点。如果他们看不到你，他们只会认为这是无知和无所畏惧。这是一个内部人士。于是当时的大新闻就被各个欧美娱乐微博报道了，其中就包括这个，谁不是你哥。他的人品太恶劣，让业内人士看不下去，所以他泄露了合同。如果你不知道，就去询问核实。我五分钟就找到了美国各大媒体的报道。不求证，就不知道事实。那你为什么还要维护你的兄弟呢？评论和图片，之前不是说因为合同不能谴责wa然后就被坑了么？这不是谎言吗？他告诉metoo，wa有合同限制，wa说公关不允许壁花双方欺骗。

Do you think that free choice or inclination is actually a kind of coercion influenced by trends?",就个人意愿而言，您的孩子可以使用任何姓氏。但问题是，社会风气是父姓自然，与母姓格格不入。这导致了一种沉默以及女性姓氏权的丧失。您认为自由选择或倾向实际上是一种受潮流影响的强制吗？

60511,我觉得这恰好是男女双方对出轨的区别对待，李小璐女明星受众面大多是男粉丝，一直被锤；陈赫男明星受众面大多是女粉丝，洗的白白的。,0.0,3,I think this is exactly how men and women treat cheating differently. The female star Li Xiaolu is mostly targeted by male fans and has always been criticized; the male star Chen He is mostly targeted by female fans and gets away with it in vain.,我认为这正是男人和女人对待出轨的不同方式。女明星李小璐多为男粉丝针对，一直饱受诟病；男明星陈赫多半是被女粉丝盯上，却侥幸逃脱。
60512,然而女权就是被那群打着女权旗号到处侮辱女性的恶心玩意给污名化的，真的不知道能说出“被砍死的怎么不是她”的东西有什么脸能代表女权，如果真正想维护女性权利的人们不与这种人都不算是的东西作斗争那女性权利永远无法得到维护,0.0,3,"However, women's rights have been stigmatized by those disgusting things that insult women everywhere under the banner of women's rights.

60524,是，施暴者确实曾为社会做了一些贡献。但现在看来他们的努力付出不过是为了爬得更高，是为了获得名利、权势。有了权势地位，他们就能轻松欺压弱者。那些为施暴者发声的，本质也是权力的卫道士，他们也是一条船上的人。,0.0,3,"Yes, the perpetrator has indeed made some contributions to society.

Two views were expressed several times. ①The most arrogant and exciting people on the Internet are almost completely defeated in reality. ②Strategy is just the skill of using strength, and it is strength itself that determines the final direction. Unless your intelligence is one or several levels higher than ordinary people, such people are more inclined to work hard for their careers rather than trying to use scheming to take advantage of the other party. Therefore, it is not difficult to deduce what these are...",完全正确。两种观点多次表达。 ①网络上最嚣张、最热闹的人，在现实中几乎全军覆没。 ②策略只是运用力量的技巧，决定最终方向的是力量本身。除非你的智力比普通人高出一个或几个级别，否则这样的人更倾向于为自己的事业而努力，而不是试图用心机来占对方的便宜。因此，不难推断出这些是什么……

However, I would feel extremely uncomfortable with some typical verbal sexism that I often encounter in the company. I don’t know how you would feel as a woman, because I would find it unacceptable.",参加工作后我才开始怀疑自己是不是真的右翼，因为在网络上我其实很反对这些过分甚至产生负面影响的“平权”运动（比如骂别人鸡巴）或生殖系统癌症）。然而，我对在公司经常遇到的一些典型的言语性别歧视感到非常不舒服。我不知道作为一个女人你会有什么感觉，因为我会觉得这是不可接受的。

A man went to a store and was dishonest. He took something and tried to sneak away. The owner saw it and said, ""Oh, there's no need to make a big fuss."" He gently said, ""Put the things down."" He didn't call the police. Ning means that this person should continue to steal next time because the owner didn't call the police? Can this be a normal person's idea? If the first theft was involuntary, and someone stopped him (even if it was gentle), he should learn to stop, right? Can you understand that a mentally normal man would not pick up a girl's suspenders for no reason, just like a mentally normal girl would not pull down a boy's pants for no reason. Come on, another perfect victim? So murderers kill because the victims don't resist fiercely enough?",如果你不能理解，我给你举个例子。一名男子去了一家商店，结果不诚实。他拿了一些东西并试图偷偷溜走。店主见了，说道：“哎呀，不用大惊小怪的。”他轻轻道：“把东西放下。”他没有报警。宁的意思是，因为主人没有报警，所以这个人下次就应该继续偷窃？这能是一个正常人的想法吗？如果第一次盗窃是非自愿的，有人阻止了他（即使是温和的），他就应该学会阻止，对吧？你能理解吗，一个精神正常的男人不会无缘无故地撩起女孩的背带，就像一个精神正常的女孩不会无缘无故地拉下男孩的裤子一样。来吧，另一个完美的受害者？那么凶手杀人是因为受害者反抗不够激烈吗？

Why do you think Zuckerberg got married the day after Facebook went public? The same goes for Liu Qiangdong in China. His assets are in the name of a foreign trust company. Once divorced, Milk Tea will not get a penny. Otherwise, why do you think Milk Tea is so tolerant of his cheating? , Li Xiaolu was scolded, wasn’t she cheating? It's ridiculous. Shouldn't you be scolded if you touch someone everywhere? In the first half of last year, Pengci Police Academy recruited students, and last year there was Pengci E-Sports at the beginning of the League of Legends tournament, ugh! Things like e-sports that rely solely on technology can be prone to sexism. First, there is no right to divide half of the property of parents, subject to the will. Take Apple founder Steve Jobs as an example. His daughter only inherited a few million dollars. Most of the property was inherited by his wife, his daughter's stepmother. Second, when a foreign couple gets married, the daughter must take the husband’s surname, so there is no issue of the children’s surname. Our country’s law stipulates that children can take the father’s or mother’s surname. One of my colleagues has his mother’s surname, and his daughter also takes her mother’s surname. , a civet got married and gave birth to a daughter, and then she relied on her husband to support her without working. She took care of the child at home, and posted on Weibo every day to shout about women’s rights and gain attention. Is this called relying on oneself?",傻瓜，外国妻子继承丈夫的财产当然很自然，只要婚后财产是夫妻共同所有。你认为扎克伯格为什么在 Facebook 上市后第二天就结婚了？中国的刘强东也是如此。他的资产在一家外国信托公司的名下。一旦离婚，奶茶一分钱都拿不到。不然你觉得奶茶为什么这么能容忍他的出轨呢？ ，李小璐被骂，她这不是出轨吗？这太荒谬了。到处碰人不应该被骂吗？去年上半年，碰瓷警校招收学员，去年英雄联盟赛事开局就有碰瓷电竞，哎呀！像电子竞技这样完全依赖技术的事情很容易出现性别歧视。首先，无权分割父母一半的财产，但须遵守遗嘱。以苹果公司创始人史蒂夫·乔布斯为例。他的女儿只继承了几百万美元。大部分财产由他的妻子、女儿的继母继承。其次，外国夫妇结婚时，女儿必须随夫姓，所以不存在孩子姓氏的问题。我国法律规定子女可以随父姓或随母姓。我的一位同事随母姓，他女儿也随母姓。果子狸结婚生了一个女儿，然后她就靠着老公养活自己，不用工作。她在家照顾孩子，每天发微博喊话女权，博取关注。这叫靠自己吗？

60836,其实就比如说高跟鞋和女人吧，高跟鞋历史上是男人的所属物，但后来它被男人抛弃了，女人才有能穿上高跟鞋。在男权社会中想展现女性气质，女性必要时穿高跟鞋很辛苦，审美被规训化。但近年来也有研究指出高跟鞋有让女性的主体性意识觉醒，高跟鞋女人不好掌控，需要挑战，代表自己。当然不同分析角度了～,0.0,3,"In fact, let’s take high-heeled shoes and women as an example. Historically, high-heeled shoes belonged to men, but later they were abandoned by men, and only women could wear high-heeled shoes. In a patriarchal society, women who want to show their femininity find it difficult to wear high heels when necessary, and their aesthetics are disciplined. However, in recent years, some studies have pointed out that high heels can awaken women's consciousness of subjectivity. Women with high heels are difficult to control and need to be challenged and represent themselves. Of course it’s a different angle of analysis~",其实我们就以高跟鞋和女人为例。历史上，高跟鞋属于男性，但后来被男性抛弃，只有女性才能穿高跟鞋。在男权社会，想要展现女性气质的女性在必要的时候很难穿高跟鞋，审美受到约束。然而，近年来，有研究指出，高跟鞋可以唤醒女性的主体意识。穿高跟鞋的女性很难控制，需要接受挑战并代表自己。当然是换个角度分析啦~

60849,如果冠姓权不重要的话那为什么不能跟母亲姓？没必要扯自己要改跟母亲姓跟姥姥姓这些，自己的姓能改就改不改就这样定了。至于主张女性争取冠姓权，这只是争取女性本来就有的权利啊有什么毛病吗？不是非逼着让所有人必须随母姓，而是让所有人尊重女性的冠姓权尊重女性的权利，是让大家尊重并有这个意识。,0.0,3,"If the right to have a surname is not important, then why can't you take your mother's surname? There is no need to talk about whether you want to change your mother's surname or grandma's surname. It's up to you whether you want to change your surname or not. As for advocating for women to fight for the right to have surnames, this is just fighting for women’s inherent rights. Is there anything wrong with that? It’s not about forcing everyone to take their mother’s surname, but asking everyone to respect a woman’s right to have a surname and respect women’s rights, and to have everyone respect and have this awareness.",如果姓氏的权利不重要，那为什么不能随母姓呢？是想改母姓还是改奶奶姓，就不用说了。是否要更改姓氏取决于您。至于提倡女性争取姓氏权，这只是争取女性与生俱来的权利。这有什么问题吗？不是强迫大家都随母姓，而是要求大家尊重女性的姓氏权利，尊重女性的权利，并且让大家尊重并有这种意识。

60851,她最早答应帮朋友忙愿意发那个投票，大概也是基于这样的逻辑。她潜意识里没有共情到切肤之痛。她道德上当然是反代孕的，但是“有群体有需求，讨论一下有何不可？”。,0.0,3,"The first time she agreed to help her friends by posting the poll was probably based on this logic. Her subconscious lack of empathy was so painful. Of course she is morally opposed to surrogacy, but ""there are groups with needs, why not discuss it?""",她第一次同意通过发布民意调查来帮助朋友，大概就是基于这个逻辑。她潜意识中缺乏同理心是非常痛苦的。她当然在道义上反对代孕，但“有需求的群体，为什么不讨论呢？”

60865,"同时中央政府虽然不能大范围控制基层，但是也不能被基层直接影响。民众只能和地方自治体系互动。公投，一人一票对于高层决策是法兰西民主暴力毒瘤，只能限于基层。这样中央权力既不能膨胀，暴民也不能发疯。美国以前就没有一人一票制度，这是二十世纪开始的倒退，是民主暴力。,卢梭的思想是民主的专制，既利用少数自负知识分子带动大众狂热。大众可以是一切平民。能消灭布尔乔亚的就是暴民，虽然布尔乔亚也可以是暴民。这种模式始于法国，发扬于苏德。,中国从来就是暴民政治的循环，这一点和法国相似。这也是为什么卢梭的激进思想在五四那段时间流行。要消灭暴民政治，需击溃法国革命这种思想瘟疫。",0.0,3,"At the same time, although the central government cannot control the grassroots on a large scale, it cannot be directly influenced by the grassroots. People can only interact with local self-government systems. Referendum, one person one vote is a violent cancer in French democracy for high-level decision-making and can only be limited to the grassroots. In this way, central power cannot expand and the mob cannot go crazy. The United States has never had a one-person-one-vote system. This is a retrogression that began in the 20th century and is a form of democratic violence. , Rousseau's idea is democratic autocracy, which uses a small number of conceited intellectuals to drive mass fanaticism. The public can be all civilians. What can destroy the bourgeoisie is the mob, although a bourgeoisie can also be a mob. This model began in France and was carried forward in the Soviet Union and Germany. , China has always been a cycle of mob politics, which is similar to France. This is why Rousseau's radical ideas were popular during the May Fourth Movement. To eliminate mob politics, the ideological plague of the French Revolution needs to be defeated.",同时，中央政府虽然无法大规模控制基层，但也无法直接受到基层的影响。人们只能与当地的自治系统互动。公投、一人一票是法国民主对于高层决策的毒瘤，只能局限于基层。这样，中央权力就无法扩张，暴民就无法疯狂。美国从来没有实行一人一票制度。这是始于20世纪的倒退，是民主暴力的一种形式。卢梭的思想是民主专制，它利用少数自负的知识分子来带动大众的狂热。公众可以是所有平民。能够消灭资产阶级的是暴民，资产阶级也可以是暴民。这种模式始于法国，并在苏联和德国得到发扬光大。 ，中国一直是暴民政治的循环，这与法国类似。这就是卢梭的激进思想在五四运动期间流行的原因。要消除暴民政治，就必须战胜法国大革命的意识形态瘟疫。

I am also opposed to men earning money to support the family. In today’s society, there are always social responsibility requirements for men or some tradition of earning money to support the family. In fact, there is nothing wrong with men running the house or being weak. There's nothing wrong with being a man",我不否认部分男性受到歧视，但总体就业趋势是对女性的歧视。我也反对男人赚钱养家。当今社会，总是对男性有社会责任的要求，或者有一些赚钱养家的传统。其实，男人持家、软弱都没有什么错。作为一个男人并没有什么错

60877,"哦，还有，以前女性没办法出门工作也是由于男权社会对女性进行制约，认为女性就应该在家相夫教子，抛头露面就是丢脸。我也非常高兴看到越来越多女性出现在各行各业中实现除了相夫教子的价值，这是女权通过抗争得来的自由。其实，这不叫女权，这叫人权。男性制约女性发展，这叫男权。,在你的观点中直接把这位女生打成了不工作，不做家务，天天花男人的钱的人,还有；女性的道德要求普遍比男性高。女性和外籍男结婚就是崇洋媚外，男性和外籍女结婚就是为国争光；还有你说的什么女性是原装的理论，男性的婚前性行为不受谴责，而女性则被称作二手货。这些只是你们享受惯了，所以不觉得这是男权。,其次吧，你说的男权我可以举例子；男女同工同酬的比例只占到了0.64；家庭中男女双方都工作，女方还要肩负起照顾家庭，照顾小孩的工作（参照丧偶式教育）；女性在职场受歧视，因为孕假而且要照顾小孩；家庭主妇的价值不被体现（古代女性都是男性的附属品）等等。",0.0,3,"Oh, and also, in the past, women could not go out to work because of the restrictions imposed on women by the patriarchal society. They believed that women should stay at home, take care of their husbands and raise children, and it would be embarrassing to show up in public. I am also very happy to see more and more women appearing in all walks of life to realize their value in addition to being a husband and raising children. This is the freedom that women’s rights gain through struggle. In fact, this is not called women’s rights, it is called human rights. Men restrict the development of women, this is called patriarchy. , in your point of view, you directly label this girl as someone who doesn’t work, doesn’t do housework, and spends men’s money every day. Also, women generally have higher moral requirements than men. When a woman marries a foreign man, she worships foreigners, and when a man marries a foreign woman, he brings glory to the country. What about the theory that women are originals? Men’s premarital sex is not condemned, while women are called second-hand goods. These are just things you are used to enjoying, so you don’t think it’s male dominance. , Secondly, I can give you an example of male supremacy; the proportion of equal pay for men and women for equal work is only 0.64; both men and women in the family work, and the woman also has to take care of the family and children (refer to the widowed education); women They are discriminated against in the workplace because they are on pregnancy leave and have to take care of children; the value of housewives is not reflected (women in ancient times were accessories to men) and so on.","哦,还有,在过去,由于父权社会对女性的限制,女性是不能出去工作的。他们认为女性应该呆在家里，照顾丈夫、抚养孩子，出现在公共场合会很尴尬。我也很高兴看到越来越多的女性出现在各行各业，除了做丈夫、养孩子之外，还实现了自己的价值。这就是女权通过斗争获得的自由。其实这不叫女权，这叫人权。男性限制女性的发展，这就是父权制。在你看来，你直接给这个女孩贴上不工作、不做家务、天天花男人钱的标签。而且，女性的道德要求普遍高于男性。女人嫁给外国男人，就崇拜外国人；男人娶外国女人，就为国家带来荣耀。女性具有原创性的理论又如何呢？男人的婚前性行为不被谴责，而女人则被称为二手货。这些只是你习惯享受的事情，所以你不认为这是男性主导。 ，其次，我可以给你举一个男权至上的例子；男女同工同酬比例仅为0.64；男人和女人都参与家庭工作，女人还要照顾家庭和孩子（指丧偶教育）；女性因休产假、还要照顾孩子而在工作场所受到歧视；家庭主妇的价值没有体现（古代女人是男人的附属品）等等。"

Forget it, I don’t care if I don’t tell you, your logic is like having a wife in the wife cake. Then let me ask you, according to your logic, does a female man count as a man or a woman? I said there is no definition at the beginning, let me tell you the definition. But you don’t want to accept it and say it is for self-entertainment. Forget it, just be happy. If anyone thinks that straight men’s cancer must be male, they can only say that he is right. There is a misunderstanding about this term, and no one says that cancer in straight men must be male. If you insist on saying that you don’t have something that has a definition, what else can you say? To take a step back, since you think this is something that doesn’t even have a definition, why should you label it? , then I tell you that the definition of straight male cancer refers to a group that is self-righteous and ignores the role of women or objectifies women. Do you want to refute? , what standard is the definition you are talking about based on? From a normal person's point of view, the word ""straight male cancer"" is obviously not something that can be used casually regardless of the situation. It depends on how you feel unhappy about it. If you say that you can call someone ""straight male cancer"" just by seeing someone unhappy, then this I have never heard of this principle before, and it seems that this is not the principle taught by the speaker. As for definitions, Internet vocabulary also has its own meaning, which cannot be ignored. Just like the word ""face"", although it is not an Internet word, if you study it carefully, there is no explanation in the Chinese dictionary. You still gave the so-called accurate meaning.",你认为凡是带有“男”字的词一定是指男性吗？ 。 。算了，不告诉你也无所谓，你的逻辑就像老婆饼里有老婆一样。那我问你，按照你的逻辑，女汉子算男人还是女人？我一开始就说了没有定义，我告诉你定义。但你不愿意接受，说这是自娱自乐。算了，开心就好。如果有人认为直男癌一定是男性，只能说他是对的。对于这个词有一个误解，没有人说直男得癌症一定是男性。如果你坚持说你没有某种东西有定义，你还能说什么？退一步讲，既然你认为这是连定义都没有的东西，为什么要给它贴上标签呢？那我告诉你，直男癌的定义是指自以为是、无视女性角色或者物化女性的群体。你想反驳吗？ ，你所说的定义是基于什么标准？从正常人的角度来看，“直男癌”这个词显然不是无论什么情况都可以随便使用的。这取决于你对此感到不高兴。如果你说只要看到一个人不开心就可以称他为“直男癌”，那么这个道理我以前从来没有听说过，而且似乎这也不是说话者所教导的原理。至于定义，网络词汇也有其自身的含义，不容忽视。就像“面子”这个词，虽然不是网络词，但仔细研究一下，汉语词典里也没有解释。你还是给出了所谓准确的意思。

The news media is an industry that exposes reality. However, for the sake of click-through rate and public curiosity, the modern media has produced various ""clickbait parties"" and exaggerated public opinions! This has led to social public opinion being guided by the media and becoming one-sided. In today's society, there is little use in blaming others.

After sorting it out, I took a quick look and found that the words spoken in many places were indeed very bad, even to the point of being vulgar. But looking at these things... he is just an ordinary person, and he really is not as ""essential as xxx"" as those who want him dead say.",是的。 。并不是所有的人在成名之前都是普通人。如果这被认为是黑料……甚至上升到人物层面，其实是非常不恰当和极端的。情况就是这样。肖战过去所谓的“黑料”，已经被别人利用了。整理了一下，我快速浏览了一下，发现很多地方说的话确实很不好，甚至到了粗俗的地步。但看这些事情……他只是一个普通人，他确实不像那些想要他死的人所说的那样“像xxx一样重要”。

61200,"我觉得这篇长微博里有一个词很有趣：越界。 在社交场所，应该可以假定绝大多数人都在扮演他们觉得自己应该扮演的角色。而在一些女性的想象中，在社交场所可以扮演的角色实在屈指可数，并且在一些女性中间就是有这种相互奚落相互舔舐伤口的社交。某种意义上，这也意味着她们对对方的详细观察。,在社交场所里，有意或是无意地扮演一个未知的角色，这对于任何一个试图融入其中的参与者而言，都会担心自己收到的评价。未知的评价就是对原有界限的打破，当这个人意识到这一点后，她可能因为恐惧未知的评价而放弃扮演未知的，“越界”的角色。,如果越界指的是超过普通陌生男女交流的界限，那我是否可以理解为你们在扮演着互相试探的男女呢？就像你可以在电视上，文章里，以及别人的口中，经过或大或小的理解想象后的形象。 如果越界只是指社交越界，那我便要怀疑博主是否缺乏真诚，真诚地看见对方的心理状态，真诚地说话，让双方不尴尬地表演。,一个女性在去社交的时候，就在原本表演为女人的表面再加一层界限和指导，无论是心理上还是衣着服饰妆容上。这些东西是如此复杂以至于她的注意力完全集中在这些事上，成败取决于完美毫无瑕疵的细节。这也是一个原因。,因为只有通过详细观看并且归类对方的特征，并且给这一切按照感觉/直觉评分，找到话题，调动情绪，才能让这一切不那么无趣。这也是对话缺乏内容的体现。这种话和博主这样的人说的时候，自然会涉及到经常被别人说的男女性别差异，甚至是自己遇到的性别歧视问题。对方也有可能在刺探你的态度。",0.0,3,"I think there is an interesting word in this long microblog: crossing the line. In social places, it should be assumed that most people are playing the roles they think they should play. In the imagination of some women, there are only a few roles that can be played in social places, and some women have this kind of social interaction of mutual ridicule and licking wounds. In a sense, this also means that they observe each other in detail. In social places, intentionally or unintentionally playing an unknown role, for any participant who tries to fit in, they will worry about the evaluation they will receive. Unknown evaluation is the breaking of the original boundary. When this person realizes this, she may give up playing the unknown, ""cross-border"" role because of fear of unknown evaluation. If crossing the line means exceeding the boundary of ordinary communication between strangers, then can I understand that you are playing the role of men and women testing each other? Just like you can see the image of each other on TV, in articles, and in the mouths of others after a greater or lesser understanding and imagination. If crossing the line only refers to social crossing, then I have to doubt whether the blogger lacks sincerity, sincere seeing of the other party's psychological state, and sincere speaking, so that both parties can perform without embarrassment. ,When a woman goes to socialize, she adds another layer of boundaries and guidance to the surface of her original performance as a woman, whether it is psychological or in terms of clothing, clothing and makeup. These things are so complicated that her attention is completely focused on these things, and success or failure depends on perfect and flawless details. This is also a reason. ,Because only by observing and classifying the characteristics of the other party in detail, and scoring all of this according to feelings/intuition, finding topics, and mobilizing emotions, can all this be made less boring. This is also a manifestation of the lack of content in the conversation. When talking to people like bloggers, this kind of talk will naturally involve the gender differences between men and women that are often mentioned by others, or even the gender discrimination problems encountered by oneself. The other party may also be trying to spy on your attitude.",我觉得这篇长微博里有一个词很有趣：越界。在社交场合，应该假设大多数人都在扮演他们认为应该扮演的角色。在一些女性的想象中，社交场所中能扮演的角色就只有那么几个，而有的女性就有这种互相嘲讽、舔舐伤口的社交。从某种意义上来说，这也意味着他们在细致地观察对方。在社交场合，有意无意地扮演着一个未知的角色，对于任何试图融入其中的参与者来说，都会担心自己会受到怎样的评价。未知的评价是对原有界限的打破。当这个人认识到这一点时，她可能会因为害怕未知的评价而放弃扮演未知的、“跨界”的角色。如果说越界就意味着超出了陌生人之间正常交往的界限，那么我是否可以理解为你在扮演男女互相试探的角色？就像你可以在电视上、文章中、别人的口中经过或多或少的了解和想象后看到彼此的形象。如果跨界仅仅指社交跨越，那么我不得不怀疑博主是否缺乏诚意，真诚地看到对方的心理状态，真诚地说话，让双方都能表现得不尴尬。 ，当女人去社交的时候，无论是心理上，还是衣着打扮上，妆容上，她都在她原本作为女人的表现的表面上又多了一层界限和引导。这些事情太复杂了，以至于她的注意力完全集中在这些事情上，成败取决于完美无瑕的细节。这也是一个原因。 ，因为只有详细观察和分类对方的特征，并根据感觉/直觉对这一切进行评分，找到话题，调动情绪，才能让这一切变得不那么无聊。这也是谈话内容缺乏的表现。与博主这样的人交谈时，这种谈论自然会涉及到别人经常提到的男女性别差异，甚至是自己遇到的性别歧视问题。对方也可能想窥探你的态度。

61210,没说归没说，但是Woody就是这么理解茶的态度的。茶发声是在twitter发的，你认为一个八十几岁的老头子会上推特？Woody可能就是听别人说谁谁谁挺他啦，谁谁谁后悔合作啦。加上一句茶没说的也情有可原。这属于写书时查资料不严谨的错误。,0.0,3,"I didn’t say it, but that’s how Woody understood Cha’s attitude. Cha’s voice was posted on Twitter. Do you think an old man in his 80s can use Twitter? Woody may have heard others say that so-and-so supported him, and that so-and-so regretted cooperating with him. It’s understandable that I didn’t say anything about tea. This is a mistake of not checking the information carefully when writing a book.",虽然我没说，但伍迪就是这么理解车的态度的。查的声音发布在推特上。你认为80多岁的老人会用Twitter吗？伍迪可能听别人说某某支持他，某某后悔与他合作。我没有说任何关于茶的事情，这是可以理解的。这是写书时不仔细核对资料的错误。

Are you spreading rumors so much that even the court and the police don’t believe it? , look, this is the quality of the woman’s fans, they will only curse without evidence. Let me show you the original words of a California legal practitioner 👉 “Just the words admitted and averred in the legal document are indeed the woman’s admission, It's just before the trial. Before the trial, both parties can submit documents called interrogatories to indicate whether the narrative content in the other party's answer document is true or false.

For the link, please go to the comment below the most popular blog post I just posted. The link I posted will be blocked. The article The red line ""averred"" in the calligraphy and painting means legal proof that it is true, and it is not one-sided evidence. This is the result of Amber's admission of domestic violence.

61268,"最后，请将这些告知你的女权姐妹尤其是你的女儿，听不听是她的事，不要强迫。你做了该做的，一切后果自负，没有人为我们的人生负责，只有我们自己需要为我们的人生负责,就算已经去打了疫苗也不能不戴套，最安全的当然是不做。 这个病毒比较凶猛，小红书上有姐妹去新西兰打了HPV疫苗后来还是得了宫颈癌。 提示：HPV持续感染导致宫颈癌抽血查不出来，HPV病毒不通过血液传播而是上皮细胞，宫颈处有大量上皮细胞。 为数据准确不花冤枉钱，建议去正规三甲医院做妇科专项体检。,有性生活的姐妹除了要做常规体检，每年要做妇科专项检查，因为HPV持续感染导致的宫颈癌抽血查不出来，宫颈癌进展快致死率高越早发现越好。不戴套和性生活的年龄过于幼小最易感染，如在未成年时遭到性侵犯或有过不戴套经历的姐妹需要格外重视妇科专项体检。腾讯医典有，宫颈癌发病死亡率中国世界第一。",0.0,3,"Finally, please inform your feminist sisters, especially your daughter, about this. It is her business to listen or not. Don’t force it. You do what you should do, and you are responsible for all the consequences. No one is responsible for our lives, only we ourselves need to be responsible for our lives. Even if we have been vaccinated, we must wear a condom. The safest thing is of course not to do it. This virus is quite ferocious. There is a sister in Xiaohongshu who went to New Zealand to get the HPV vaccine and still got cervical cancer. Tip: Persistent HPV infection leads to cervical cancer that cannot be detected by blood testing. The HPV virus is not transmitted through blood but through epithelial cells, and there are a large number of epithelial cells in the cervix. In order to get accurate data and not waste money, it is recommended to go to a regular tertiary hospital for a special gynecological examination. In addition to routine physical examinations, sexually active sisters should also undergo special gynecological examinations every year. Cervical cancer caused by persistent HPV infection cannot be detected by blood tests. Cervical cancer progresses quickly and has a high mortality rate. The earlier it is discovered, the better. Those who do not wear condoms and have sexual intercourse at a young age are most susceptible to infection. For example, sisters who were sexually assaulted when they were minors or have had experiences without condoms need to pay special attention to special gynecological examinations. According to Tencent Medical Dictionary, China ranks first in the world in terms of cervical cancer incidence and mortality.",最后，请告知您的女权姐妹，尤其是您的女儿。听不听是她的事。不要强迫它。你做了你应该做的事，你要对一切后果负责。没有人对我们的生活负责，只有我们自己需要对我们的生活负责。即使我们已经接种了疫苗，我们也必须戴安全套。最安全的做法当然是不做。这种病毒相当凶猛。小红书有位姐姐去新西兰打了HPV疫苗，结果还是得了宫颈癌。提示：持续的 HPV 感染会导致血液检测无法检测到的宫颈癌。 HPV病毒不通过血液传播，而是通过上皮细胞传播，宫颈内存在大量的上皮细胞。为了得到准确的数据，不浪费钱，建议去正规的三级医院做专门的妇科检查。除了常规体检外，性生活活跃的姐妹每年还应该进行专门的妇科检查。由持续 HPV 感染引起的宫颈癌无法通过血液检查检测出来。宫颈癌进展快，死亡率高。越早发现越好。年轻时不戴安全套、发生性行为的人最容易受到感染。比如，未成年时被性侵或者有过不戴安全套经历的姐妹，就需要特别注意专门的妇科检查。据腾讯医学词典显示，我国宫颈癌发病率和死亡率均居世界第一。

China has socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is different from the Soviet Union, so it is okay.",从1945年到1968年有多少年了？贫穷导致混乱。苏联的计划经济最初是成功的，但连美帝国主义者都害怕。后来美帝阵营的经济复苏和星球大战拖垮了苏联经济。没有苏联、东欧，没有投入，整个阵营就完蛋了。中国有中国特色社会主义，跟苏联不一样，所以没关系。

61312,值得一提的是，指控伍迪艾伦的前妻米亚法罗，在波兰斯基案里是为波兰斯基发声的。以喜欢两位大导的影迷身份来看，明明伍迪艾伦的过错要轻得多：1、司法审判被判无罪；2，从未有合作过的女演员提出指控；3，跟继养女结婚是合法的，争议主要是伦理问题。,0.0,3,"It is worth mentioning that Mia Farrow, the ex-wife who accused Woody Allen, spoke out for Polanski in the Polanski case.

He knew that the heroine was ill, and he still questioned whether it was true. It was only after the heroine died that the hero really began to regret it. I feel like she has a very thorough understanding of human nature. It's a pity that reality is not like fiction, which will give you the opportunity to be reborn or start over.",我同意，她的很多结局都是女主角死后，男主角觉得女主角很珍贵。这也是事实。只有彻底失去之后，他才会想珍惜，就像当年曼里的男主角与女主角分开一样。到最后，他并没有感到很悔恨。他知道女主角生病了，但他仍然怀疑这是否是真的。直到女主死后，男主才真正开始后悔。我感觉她对人性的理解非常透彻。可惜现实不像小说那样会给你重生或者重新开始的机会。

Yes, women's rights in our country are messy and low-level, and they are often targeted by various forces. However, the living conditions of women in our country are also very different from others. Can we face it? this point. To put it more directly, my country’s media trials generally target victims. Female victims suffer slut humiliation, while male offenders are “admired” by men. This is the most likely current situation of my country’s Internet.",从评论来看，充满了对我国女权的嘲讽。是的，我国的女权是杂乱的、低水平的，常常受到各种势力的针对。然而，我国女性的生活状况也与其他国家有很大不同。我们能面对吗？这点。更直接地说，我国的媒体审判一般都是针对受害者的。女性受害者遭受荡妇羞辱，而男性犯罪者则受到男性的“钦佩”。这就是我国互联网最有可能的现状。

62002,我其实很佩服那些能够争取到冠性权的女性。大部分女孩子不是不想争而是争不到，女生争不到冠姓权，而说无所谓，这不是真无所谓而是假大方。而papi对于她而言，我个人愿意相信她应该不是争不到，而是她真的爱她老公，愿意生一个孩子和他老公姓。这其实是最理想的状态了，女性拥有冠姓权有自由选择的权利,0.0,3,"I actually admire those women who are able to fight for the right to have sex. It’s not that most girls don’t want to fight but they can’t fight for it. Girls can’t fight for the right to have a surname, so they say it doesn’t matter.

As for Papi, I personally want to believe that it’s not that she can’t win, but that she really loves her husband and is willing to have a child with his husband’s surname. This is actually the most ideal situation. Women have the right to have surnames and the right to choose freely.",我其实很佩服那些能够争取性权利的女性。大多数女孩并不是不想奋斗，而是不敢去奋斗。女孩子不能争取姓氏的权利，所以她们说无所谓。这不是真正的冷漠，而是虚假的慷慨。至于Papi，我个人更愿意相信，不是她赢不了，而是她真心爱自己的丈夫，愿意生一个跟夫姓的孩子。这其实是最理想的情况。妇女有拥有姓氏的权利和自由选择的权利。
62003,让我想到迈克尔杰克逊的娈童案也是死后才翻案，但是多少人关心真相呢？人们只相信看到他内心想看到的，丑恶是非。媒体为了流量无所不用其极，往往不经考证。《灾难艺术家》里提到希区柯克拍《群鸟》，故意把演员关在黑暗空间，往他们身上扔活鸟，让人很害怕。但是能说他是坏人吗？眼下人嘲般的道德绑架,0.0,3,"It reminds me that Michael Jackson's child molestation case was overturned after his death, but how many people care about the truth?

""The Disaster Artist"" mentioned that when filming ""The Birds"", Hitchcock deliberately locked the actors in a dark space and threw live birds on them, which was very scary. But can we say he is a bad person? The current mocking moral kidnapping",这让我想起迈克尔·杰克逊的猥亵儿童案在他死后被翻案，但又有多少人关心真相呢？人们只相信看到自己内心想看到的东西，这是丑陋和错误的。媒体会不择手段地获取流量，但往往未经核实。 《灾难艺术家》提到，在拍摄《鸟儿》时，希区柯克故意把演员锁在黑暗的空间里，并向他们扔活鸟，非常吓人。但我们能说他是坏人吗？当下嘲讽的道德绑架

62011,所以你就是觉得他信口开河给Timmy塑造一个落井下石的形象没错咯…我不知道他看不上奥斯卡sorry啊…但他看不上奥斯卡跟知道奥斯卡前的公关很重要也不冲突吧？Timmy当时被媒体步步紧逼了一段时间才说捐款，为了堵住媒体人的嘴，可也没有嘴过一句伍迪·艾伦，艾伦是真不理解Timmy的难处吗？小心眼罢了……,0.0,3,"So you just think that he is right to create an image that adds insult to injury to Timmy with his talk...I don't know that he doesn't like the Oscar, sorry...but it doesn't conflict with the fact that he doesn't like the Oscar and he knows that public relations before the Oscar is very important, right? Timmy was pressed hard by the media for a while before he offered to donate. In order to silence the media people, he never said a word about Woody Allen. Did Allen really not understand Timmy's difficulties? Just being cautious...",所以你只是认为他用他的演讲创造了一个对蒂米雪上加霜的形象是正确的……我不知道他不喜欢奥斯卡，抱歉……但这并不冲突他不喜欢奥斯卡，但他知道奥斯卡之前的公共关系非常重要，对吧？许魏洲在媒体的逼迫下，主动提出捐款。为了让媒体人闭嘴，他对伍迪·艾伦只字不提。难道艾伦真的不理解提米的难处吗？只是要小心谨慎...

62042,人家就是没性别歧视，摁着头说人家性别歧视，还这要举报，那要开除的，还有只有官博自己知道的私信换谁谁都暴走。只不过一个官博这样是不是不太好还是觉得这样没问题就看人家公司自己的风格了，人家不想客户就是妈咋骂都行骂得不对我也接受，怼怼也没啥啊。就看后来会不会为刻板印象道歉吧。,0.0,3,"People just don't have sex discrimination, but they hold their heads down and say that they are sexist, and they have to report this, and they have to be fired. There are also private messages that only the official blog knows about, and everyone goes berserk. It's just that whether it's not good for an official blog to be like this or whether it's okay depends on the company's own style. If they don't want customers, they can scold them all they want. Let’s see if he apologizes for the stereotype later.",人们就是没有性别歧视，却低着头说自己有性别歧视，必须举报，必须被解雇。还有只有官博知道的私信，大家都疯了。只是官方博客这样是不好还是可以，就看公司自己的风格了。如果他们不想要顾客，他们想骂就骂。让我们看看他稍后是否会为刻板印象道歉。

I am very curious. Please give me the address so I can go and see it. However, after seeing it, I don’t care about other people’s affairs. Just like I am too lazy to support Depp and Amber. I only care about using other people’s family affairs to boycott Aquaman. In the end, after a long detour, it still originated from my answer to your question about where to see brainwashing packages dancing. I am referring to some fans who have made excessive behaviors. There are extreme brain-dead fans in every fan circle. I will also criticize DC’s extreme brain-dead fans. 3. The rogue behaviors and messages made by extreme fans that I mentioned are affecting Aquaman. This is really inexcusable. In summary, I explained my three points again. You think I am arguing. I don’t know why. Isn’t this a discussion? I have also read multiple versions of translations and so-called evidence. It is hard to explain other people’s affairs. To be honest, these two people are not people who live together. They all have black spots. When there is a big conflict, no one can distance themselves from the relationship and say that they are innocent. But the most critical thing is the rogue-like unilateral popularization and boycott behavior of some NC fans. These behaviors are affecting DCEU without a doubt.",你说NC女粉丝追着罗琳阿姨骂。我很好奇。请给我地址，以便我去看看。不过，看过之后，我就不再关心别人的事情了。就像我懒得支持德普和安布尔一样。我只关心利用别人的家事来抵制海王。最终，绕了一大圈，还是源于我回答你关于哪里可以看到洗脑包跳舞的问题。我指的是一些做出过分行为的粉丝。每个粉丝圈子里都有极端的脑残粉丝。我也会批评DC那些极端脑残的粉丝。 3.我提到的极端粉丝的流氓行为和信息正在影响海王。这实在是不可原谅。综上，我再次阐述了我的三点。你以为我在争论。我不知道为什么。这不是讨论吗？我也读过多个版本的翻译和所谓的证据。别人的事情很难解释。说实话，这两个人并不是住在一起的人。它们都有黑点。当发生大的矛盾时，没有人能够撇清关系，说自己是无辜的。但最关键的是一些NC粉丝的流氓式单方面普及和抵制行为。这些行为无疑正在影响着DCEU。
62058,宣传女权是让女性懂得去保护自己的权利，而不是让女性觉得我就得有特权，而且，女性不选择你们那一套想法也是她们都权利,0.0,3,"Promoting women's rights is to let women know how to protect their own rights, rather than making women think that I have to have privileges.

There are very few people who truly pursue equality like the West, and the gap is huge. They only want to say four words, but they are not good at learning. I hope that life can be as sharp and angular, and not just about arguing about merits and demerits online.",女权主义起源于西方，传入中国后有自己的一套标准和逻辑价值观。像西方这样真正追求平等的人少之又少，差距巨大。他们只想说四个字，但他们不善于学习。希望生活也能如此锋利、有棱角，而不仅仅是在网上争论功过。

62078,当你说WA性侵第一个报警的是个医生（因为美国法律这类情况要立即报警），因为法罗养母带她去看了医生当时以为她只是生病了结果才发现的。所以要说是前妻污蔑根本不成立,0.0,3,"When you say that the first person to report WA's sexual assault was a doctor (because of US law, such cases must be reported immediately), because Farrow's adoptive mother took her to see a doctor and thought she was just sick, but she didn't find out until later. Therefore, it is simply not true to say that the ex-wife is slandering her.",当你说第一个举报WA性侵事件的人是一名医生时（因为美国法律，此类案件必须立即举报），因为法罗的养母带她去看医生，以为她只是生病了，但她并没有‘稍后才知道。所以，说前妻诽谤她根本就不成立。
62080,法官不但判Allen败诉，还在判决书里说Woody Allen的行为严重不适当，要求采取措施保护Dylan；检察官也公开说明不起诉的原因不是罪证不足，而是怕二度伤害儿童。Allen团队提出的不在场证词和评估报告，则被法官、检察官甚至警方判定不可采信。,0.0,3,"The judge not only ruled against Allen, but also stated in the verdict that Woody Allen's behavior was seriously inappropriate and required measures to be taken to protect Dylan; the prosecutor also publicly stated that the reason for not prosecuting was not insufficient evidence, but the fear of harming children again.

62081,正是因为女性议题受到的关注还不够 大家才会认为这个议题特殊 只有哪一天所有关于女性权益和价值的观念都不再被区别对待或故意抬高 女性才可能实现真正独立和自由,0.0,3,It is precisely because women’s issues have not received enough attention that everyone thinks this issue is special. Only when the day comes when all concepts about women’s rights and values ​​are no longer treated differently or deliberately elevated will women be able to achieve true independence and freedom.,正是因为女性问题没有得到足够的重视，大家才觉得这个问题很特殊。只有有一天，一切关于女性权利和价值的观念不再被区别对待或刻意抬高，女性才有可能实现真正的独立和自由。

62084,"哦对我觉得他挺奇怪的…讲真你们之间想法差异这么大，真的相处不来就不要互相消耗了吧…况且这个男的明显是想要找个结婚对象诶，选一个适合自己的不就好了，就算有问题也跟女朋友沟通啊。跑去吐槽有什么意义呢？而且改变/改造别人在我看来是挺烦的一件事情，两个成年人了，互相不适合就换个适合的呀…,不过我挺烦那个男生才开始恋爱半年就开始考虑结婚以后别人的钱要怎么花这件事的…觉得有点想太多了,我是反婚，但我是反全世界的婚姻制度，但对想结婚的人一点意见都没有，个人选择自由。国内结婚对女生是很没保障的，很容易遭遇很多事情而且法律也不保护她们权益。所以选择步入婚姻必须要谨慎。不过这些都不代表“想要结婚选择婚姻就是loser”啊。没必要强加自己的想法到别人身上去。有些人就是不懂。",0.0,3,"Oh, yes, I think he is quite strange... To be honest, your ideas are so different. If you really can't get along, don't waste each other... Besides, this man obviously wants to find a marriage partner. Choose the one that suits you. That's okay. Even if you have problems, just communicate with your girlfriend. What's the point of complaining? And changing/transforming other people is a very annoying thing to me. We are two adults. If they are not suitable for each other, just change to another one that is suitable... However, I am very annoyed that the boy started thinking about other people after getting married only half a year ago. How to spend money... I think it's a bit too much. I am anti-marriage, but I am anti-marriage system all over the world, but I have no objection at all to people who want to get married. Individuals are free to choose. Marriage in China is very insecure for girls. It is easy for girls to encounter many things and the law does not protect their rights. Therefore, you must be cautious when choosing to enter marriage. However, none of this means that ""choosing marriage if you want to get married is a loser."" There is no need to impose your own ideas on others. Some people just don't understand.",哦，是的，我觉得他挺奇怪的……说实话，你们的想法太不一样了。如果实在合不来，就别浪费彼此了……再说了，这个男人显然是想找个结婚对象。选择适合您的一款。没关系。即使有问题，也可以和女朋友沟通一下。抱怨有什么意义呢？改变/改变别人对我来说是一件非常烦人的事情。我们是两个成年人。如果彼此不合适，就换一个合适的……不过，我很恼火的是，这个男孩结婚才半年就开始想着别人了。钱怎么花……我觉得有点多了。我是反婚姻的，但是我是全世界的反婚姻制度，但是对于想结婚的人我一点也不反对。个人可以自由选择。在中国，婚姻对女孩来说非常没有安全感。女孩很容易遇到很多事情，法律不保护她们的权利。因此，在选择步入婚姻的时候一定要慎重。然而，这一切并不意味着“想结婚就选择婚姻就是失败者”。没必要把自己的想法强加给别人。有些人就是不明白。

62091,搞得大家越来越不敢讨论热点问题，被这些女权粉丝们吓坏了，追着咬。还有一个相似的事情就是说女性要保护好自己，不能说，说就是矮化女性，我寻思咋了这世界是已经全变成机器人都按程序生活了对么，我们女性都不许说要保护自己了？世界大同了？,0.0,3,"As a result, everyone is less and less afraid to discuss hot issues, and these feminist fans are frightened and chased after them. Another similar thing is that women should protect themselves. You can't say it. It dwarfs women. I wonder why the world has turned into robots and live according to programs, right? We women are not allowed to say that we need to protect ourselves. By yourself? Is the world unified?",于是，大家越来越不敢讨论热点问题，而这些女权粉丝也被吓坏了，纷纷追赶。还有一个类似的事情就是女性应该保护自己。你不能说出来。它使女性相形见绌。我想知道为什么世界变成了机器人，按照程序生活，对吧？我们女人不可以说我们需要保护自己。自己一个人吗？世界统一了吗？

62097,为什么不觉得奇怪呢？我觉得描述的这个，实际上很不清醒…用父权下的性缘关系来证明自我，在我看来有点自取灭亡的意思。可能是我“何不食肉糜”了吧,0.0,3,"Why don't you find it strange? I think what is described is actually very unclear... Using sexual relations under patriarchal authority to prove oneself is a bit suicidal in my opinion. Maybe it’s because I thought, “Why not eat minced meat”?",你怎么不觉得奇怪呢？我觉得描述的其实很不清楚……利用父权权威下的性关系来证明自己在我看来有点自杀行为。也许是因为我想“为什么不吃肉末”呢？
62098,这个必须得有意义！如果主流的舆论是不平等的，不管行动上我能做到和别人多么一样甚至更好（还比如女运动员这个），落到我个人身上都平等不了...21世纪了我亲戚还说''女的要那么多钱没用''呢，话术多得很 说来说去还是不平等。再说，从来要求先进的都是青年，学生，指望老头子们批判出新时代 怎么可能,0.0,3,"This has to make sense! If the mainstream public opinion is unequal, no matter how much I can be the same as or even better than others (for example, female athletes), it will not be equal to me personally... It is the 21st century and my relatives still say, ""It's useless for women to ask for so much money."" There are so many words to say, but it's still not equal. Besides, those who have always demanded advancement are young people and students. How is it possible to expect old men to criticize the new era?",这必须有道理！如果主流舆论不平等的话，无论我能和别人（比如女运动员）一样甚至更好多少，都无法与我个人平等……已经是21世纪了，我的亲人还说“女人要那么多钱也没用”。有很多话想说，但还是不对等。何况，一直要求上进的还是年轻人、学生。怎么可能指望老人们来批评新时代呢？
62099,哦，因为我是女的，所以要对我好点，可以,0.0,3,"Oh, because I am a woman, so be nice to me, okay",哦，因为我是女人，所以对我好一点，好吗
62100,说句比较暗黑的话，人类的天性就是压迫剥削，从我们吃的动物到人类本身的阶级，农民代替了奴隶受压迫才进入封建社会，无产阶级代替了农民受压迫才进入资本主义社会，我觉得未来只有机器人代替女性受压迫，女性才能真正解放。,0.0,3,"To put it more darkly, human nature is to oppress and exploit, from the animals we eat to the class of humans themselves. Farmers replaced slaves and were oppressed before entering feudal society. The proletariat replaced farmers and were oppressed before entering capitalist society. I think In the future, only when robots replace women's oppression can women be truly liberated.",说得更阴暗一点，人性就是压迫和剥削，从我们吃的动物到人类本身这个阶级。农民在进入封建社会之前取代了奴隶，受到压迫。无产阶级在进入资本主义社会之前取代了农民，受到压迫。我想未来只有机器人取代了女性的压迫，女性才能得到真正的解放。
62102,我有点迷惑，这个投稿意思不是别人不配说女权？宁这个发言不是从小众抱团的方式去嘲讽这个账号吗，宁这不上等人姿态[疑问],0.0,3,I'm a little confused. Doesn't this submission mean that others are not worthy of talking about women's rights? Isn’t Ning’s speech a way to ridicule this account from a small group? Ning’s attitude is not that of a classy person [Question],我有点困惑。这样的说法岂不是说明其他人不配谈论女权吗？宁的言论不就是在嘲讽这个小圈子的账号吗？宁的态度一点也不优雅[提问]
62104,为什么骗婚，还不是社会不允许同志合法，如果同志婚姻合法、真正选择去伤害一个陌生女孩的同志除了禽兽我想不会有几个吧，这才是最基本的问题，并不是所有的同志都想骗婚的，不合法就没有办法去说服家人，这才是最根本的问题,0.0,3,"The reason why marriage is cheated is not because society does not allow homosexuality to be legal. If gay marriage is legal, I think there will be only a few gays who really choose to hurt a strange girl except animals. This is the most basic problem. Not all gays Everyone wants to get married by cheating. If it is illegal, there is no way to convince the family. This is the most fundamental problem.",婚姻之所以被欺骗，并不是因为社会不允许同性恋合法。如果同性婚姻合法的话，我想除了动物之外，真正选择伤害陌生女孩的同性恋者只会屈指可数。这是最基本的问题。并不是所有的同性恋者都想通过出轨的方式结婚。如果违法的话，就没办法说服家人。这是最根本的问题。
62105,有什么值得同情的，受害人鼓起勇气揭发了他，他害怕得到制裁，就自杀了？考虑过自己老婆孩子吗？考虑过受害者多痛苦吗？有什么可死者为大、逝者已矣的？死的活该，败类,0.0,3,"What is there to sympathize with, the victim mustered up the courage to expose him, and he committed suicide because he was afraid of being punished? Have you ever considered your wife and children? Have you considered how painful the victim is? Why is it that the dead are great and the dead are gone? You deserve to die, you scum.",有什么值得同情的，受害人鼓起勇气揭发自己，因为害怕受到惩罚而自杀？你有考虑过你的妻子和孩子吗？你有没有想过受害者有多痛苦？为什么死者伟大，死者已逝？你该死，你这个人渣。

Yes, let yourself feel at ease. This feeling can only be understood but cannot be expressed in words. If you have this view on relationships, your relationship will definitely go smoothly. I think whether or not to have children is a very important thing for a couple. At least I think so. So in this case, why can't divorce? Except for example, if the woman cannot have children due to physical reasons, if the man wants a divorce, he will be condemned to death. If the two people have different ideas, then they can divorce and go to their own families. I don’t think there is anything wrong. The key is to be consistent. I don’t want a child, but I conceal it and then when the man wants a child, he says, “You treat me like a fertility machine”, exm? ,Ahaha, I think the two people agree, at least on the issue of life or not. I know a sister who said that if she is older and doesn’t want to be fined, she still wants a third child, or she just likes having more children at home. Some people are born with a preference for children, and they prefer children born by themselves, regardless of gender.",是的，这位贴心的小姑娘，快来整理一下我们微信公众平台上观众朋友给我们留言的内容吧。是的，让自己安心。这种感觉只能意会，却无法用言语表达。如果你有这样的感情观，你们的感情一定会很顺利。我觉得要不要孩子对于夫妻来说是一件非常重要的事情。至少我是这么认为的。那么既然如此，为什么不能离婚呢？除非女方因为身体原因不能生育，男方如果要离婚，就会被判死刑。如果两个人的想法不同，那么他们可以离婚，各奔东西。我不认为有什么问题。关键是要保持一致。我不想要孩子，但我隐瞒了这一点，然后当那个男人想要孩子时，他说，“你把我当作生育机器”，前？ ，哈哈，我觉得两个人是一致的，至少在生命与否的问题上。我认识一个姐妹说，如果她年纪大了，不想被罚款，她还是想要第三个孩子，或者她只是喜欢家里多生孩子。有些人生来就对孩子有偏爱，他们更喜欢自己生的孩子，无论性别。

However, the ""characteristics"" of specific cases can be captured through ideal types, and the characteristics of different ideal types can be explored and analyzed. components of a particular case to understand its causes.

The actual situation should be that the theory has insufficient explanatory power for a certain type of specific cases. At this time, we should look for other theoretical perspectives or modify the original theory. , I also want to question this point in your reply a little bit. If your ""abstract concept"" here is similar to the ""ideal type"" proposed by Max Weber, in fact, abstract concepts can explain specific cases... Abstract academic concepts or rational types can be regarded as a It is absolutely impossible to find a concept that is completely consistent with the ideal type in real life.",你可以到其他现成的理论中寻找，或者多做案例分析。如果发现大量类似的案例，就意味着现有的理论存在缺陷，应该提出新的概念。总而言之，不存在完美的单一理论框架。无论是《为我六经注释》还是《我为六经注释》，都要做好。然而，通过理想类型可以捕捉具体案例的“特征”，并可以探索和分析不同理想类型的特征。特定案例的组成部分，以了解其原因。因此，说抽象概念理论不能解释具体事例是一种误解。实际情况应该是理论对于某类具体事例解释力不足。这时，我们应该寻找其他的理论视角或者修改原有的理论。 ，我也想在你的回复中对这一点提出一点质疑。如果你这里的“抽象概念”类似于马克斯·韦伯提出的“理想类型”，其实抽象概念可以解释具体案例……抽象的学术概念或者理性类型都可以看做是一种，是绝对不可能找到的。与现实生活中的理想型完全一致的理念。

Therefore, it is not a very rigorous statement to say that women's rights are against the institution of marriage in general. The blogger is discussing the micro concept of marriage as a personal choice, rather than discussing the origin and demise of the marriage system. Opposing marriage and opposing the marriage system are two different things. Feminism also has many factions and theories.

This proves that the misogynistic environment in society that the blogger said does exist, not only for male bosses , the female boss’s malice towards her own kind is even more chilling. I was also embarrassed that my answer was inexplicably dictated by a friend. I'm not being biased, it's just that I didn't tell the whole story and only mentioned the female boss, which made people mistakenly think that I hate women and favor men. I replied to you politely, but you still fought with me, right? I explained so much, didn’t you see? ? ? When the original blogger mentioned the overall misogyny environment, my first reaction was the fact that I had heard other people’s misogyny in real life, which was used to prove that the problem mentioned by the blogger does exist. My sharp edge is always directed against enemies and not friendly forces, but that does not mean that I have a good temper and condone people who maliciously speculate about me.",友好交流中，看到博主谈到厌恶女性的环境，想到了师姐被两个女老板无故裁掉，留男不留女的经历。这证明了博主所说的社会上的厌女环境确实存在，不仅是男老板，女老板对同类的恶意更令人不寒而栗。我也很尴尬，我的回答莫名其妙地是由朋友口授的。我并不是有偏见，只是我没有讲述整个故事，只提到了女老板，让人误以为我讨厌女人，喜欢男人。我礼貌地回复你了，你却还跟我吵架是吗？我解释了这么多，你没看到吗？ ？ ？当原博主提到整体厌女环境时，我的第一反应是我在现实生活中听到过其他人的厌女症，以此来证明博主提到的问题确实存在。我的锋芒总是针对敌人而不是友军，但这并不意味着我脾气好，纵容那些恶意揣测我的人。
62325,"这是很正常的，我们每个人都会希望得利，哪怕是通过损害他人利益。但是这时候我们的另一面又会阻止我们去这么想。其实只要你没有付诸于行动，那么你怎么想都是你的自由，毕竟不能这么做还不让想一想的话，就太过分了,简而言之一句话，代孕一旦开放，你也注定沦为生育机器，这和你不想承受生育痛苦的本心背道而驰。,代孕不好不是因为它不合法，是因为它不好所以才不合法，这是个逻辑问题。代孕会导致女人彻底沦为买卖商品，人口拐卖激增，然后得益者会继续提出器官买卖合法，部分男性会强迫亲属女性去买子宫。你是个女人，所以代孕合法后，你得不到任何好处，你以为你是买方，但你也有可能沦为商品,她生的孩子还是她孩子，除非你俩结婚再离婚，孩子判你。但女方如果不傻，也随时可以留下你们交易的证据，再通过法律手段把孩子拿回来，虽然比较难，但结局不好说。你懂吗？意思是，如果你是男人，想得到个孕母很简单，找个女人结婚就行了，实际上这就是我们最常见的婚姻，丧偶式育儿还能得到免费保姆,不，你情我愿也是不可以的，不然器官买卖和d品交易也可以合法了。如果你找得到不要你钱，免费做你试管婴儿载体的女性，那就没话说了，但是你找不到的。最有可能是你母亲愿意［不是骂人，是真的在国外有这个案例，母亲自愿做了孙子的孕母",0.0,3,"This is normal, and each of us would like to gain, even if it is at the expense of others. But at this time, the other side of us will prevent us from thinking this way. In fact, as long as you don't take action, you are free to think whatever you want. After all, if you can't do this and don't let you think about it, it would be too much. In short, once surrogacy is opened, you are destined to do it. Being reduced to a fertility machine runs counter to your original intention of not wanting to endure the pain of childbirth. , surrogacy is not bad because it is illegal, it is illegal because it is bad. This is a logical question. Surrogacy will completely reduce women to commercial commodities, and human trafficking will increase. Then the beneficiaries will continue to argue that organ sales are legal, and some men will force their relatives to buy uteruses. You are a woman, so after surrogacy is legal, you will not get any benefits. You think you are a buyer, but you may also be reduced to a commodity. The child she gives birth to is still her child. Unless you get married and then divorce, the child will be judged against you. But if the woman is not stupid, she can leave evidence of your transaction at any time and then use legal means to get the child back. Although it is more difficult, the outcome is hard to say. Do you understand? It means that if you are a man, it is very easy to get a pregnant mother, just find a woman to get married. In fact, this is our most common marriage. Widow-style parenting can also get a free nanny. No, it is not allowed if you are willing to do so. Yes, otherwise organ sales and drug trade would also be legal. If you can find a woman who doesn't want your money and can be your IVF carrier for free, then there's nothing to say, but you can't find it. The most likely reason is that your mother is willing to do so.",这是正常的，我们每个人都希望获得利益，即使这是以牺牲他人为代价。但这个时候，我们的另一面就会阻止我们这样想。事实上，只要你不采取行动，你想怎么想就怎么想。毕竟，如果做不到这一点，也不让你想，那就太过分了。总之，代孕一旦开启，你就注定要这么做。沦为生育机器，与你不想承受分娩痛苦的初衷背道而驰。 ，代孕不是因为非法而不好，而是因为不好所以非法。这是一个逻辑问题。代孕将把妇女完全沦为商业商品，人口贩卖将会增加。然后受益人会继续辩称器官买卖是合法的，一些男性会强迫亲戚购买子宫。你是女性，所以代孕合法后，你不会得到任何好处。你以为你是买家，但你也可能沦为商品。她生下的孩子仍然是她的孩子。除非你结婚然后离婚，否则孩子会受到对你不利的评判。但如果女方不傻的话，她可以随时留下你的交易证据，然后用法律手段把孩子要回来。虽然难度较大，但结果却很难说。你明白吗？意思是说，如果你是一个男人，想要怀孕妈妈是很容易的，只要找个女人结婚就可以了。其实这就是我们最常见的婚姻。寡妇式育儿还可以得到免费保姆。不，如果你愿意的话，这是不允许的。是的，否则器官买卖和毒品交易也是合法的。如果你能找到一个不要你的钱，可以免费做你的试管婴儿的女人，那没什么好说的，但你就是找不到。最有可能的原因是你妈妈愿意这样做。

Nowadays, no such unscrupulous harasser dares to sue, because suing is a joke.",仅供参考，这是唯一一位具有全球影响力的韩国诗人，竟然还有如此不堪的事情。有些否认、逃避、沉迷其实是没有用的，只会让自己的丑陋程度变得更糟。甚至扬言要起诉受害人或揭发者，更是无耻，当然也会让社会更加鄙视和愤怒。他们怎么敢起诉？这种丑陋的行为已经被曝光在世人面前。如今，没有哪个无良骚扰者敢起诉，因为起诉就是个笑话。

62514,"英皇直播的英文字幕：I feel the happiness of love has vanished for ever. My heart will never know happiness again 才是正真的直译。,这版的英文字幕也不是直译，可能是直接用了某个英文剧本，整体比较讲究的是英文的对仗和押韵，而不是德文原意。比如这里翻译成了：I feel it now! The empty sadness! Gone forever love's delight! Gone forever joy and gladness! Every brightness turned to night!,中文译文是“神圣的爱情永远消失了，如今不再有甜美的狂喜时光，至喜的时间，来取悦我的心房！”三区字幕很多时候找的作家而不是翻译家来翻译，有时意译会比较严重，但通篇质量暂时不是我们内地现有的译文所能比的。这个译本应该是香港人翻的，有很多偏粤语的遣词造句。",0.0,3,"The English subtitles of Emperor Live: I feel the happiness of love has vanished for ever.

From this point of view, I think whether it is taking care of children, the elderly or buying a house, men and women should each bear half of it. Men and women must be financially independent.

When the popularity increased, the top Weibo post was changed to ""Everything I say will be criticized."" , I don’t pay much attention to her, I only know that a long time ago, she was a strong independent woman who didn’t have children for many years and she just let everything happen.

However, this time many of the feminist bloggers who mocked her with her surname have their accounts blocked, and their maximum traffic is only 100,000 followers. Some time ago, the number of people who divorced because of her surname was only 10,000 followers, and they were blocked twice in a row.

62596,恐惧源于未知，我们对于性侵害的恐惧一部分原因是：似乎对方的行为在社会上并不稀奇，为什么我的感觉不对，为什么对方会做这样的事。如果两人情投意合，那自然不存在什么性侵害，因为双方能感受到对方的感受。而有一类心理不太健康的人，他感受不到他人的情绪，就像用了迷幻药一样活在自己的幻觉中。,0.0,3,"Fear comes from the unknown.

However, there is a type of mentally unhealthy person who cannot feel other people's emotions. It is like taking psychedelic drugs and living in his own hallucinations.",恐惧来自于未知。我们对性侵犯的恐惧部分是因为对方的行为在社会上似乎很常见。为什么我感觉不对劲？为什么对方会做出这样的事呢？如果两个人相爱，那么就不存在性侵犯，因为双方都能感受到对方的感受。然而，有一种精神不健康的人无法感受到别人的情绪。这就像服用迷幻药物并生活在自己的幻觉中一样。

The main reason is that the efficiency of case handling is too low and grievances cannot be redressed.",最终，韩国此类由来已久的老案子却因证据不足等原因而被忽视。这不是监管部门和警察的失职吗？更严重的是，人们在电币交易后闭上眼睛不予理睬的事件越来越多。主要原因是办案效率太低，冤屈无法平反。

62610,十分赞同。悲哀的现实是，往往只有一个流氓才能对付另一个流氓，君子要得胜，要么靠“天道”偶尔睡醒，要么等下辈子。一种宗教需要另一种宗教来制服：穆斯林要血洗个什么，到头来是红脖子持枪去守卫。无神论者要得胜，得靠脑子--更多的是常识而非纯智力。欧洲虽然liberal，但像Dawkins这样的还是太少。,0.0,3,"Totally agree. The sad reality is that often only one gangster can deal with another gangster.

To win, atheists have to rely on their brains - more common sense than pure intellect. Although Europe is liberal, there are still too few people like Dawkins.",完全同意。可悲的现实是，往往只有一个歹徒才能对付另一个歹徒。君子若想获胜，要么依靠“天法”偶尔从睡梦中惊醒，要么等待下辈子。一种宗教需要另一种宗教来制服：穆斯林想要洗刷他们的血迹，但最终是红脖子拿枪来守护。为了获胜，无神论者必须依靠他们的大脑——更多的是常识而不是纯粹的智力。欧洲虽然是自由派，但像道金斯这样的人还是太少了。

Because both the perpetrator and the victim know that confronting the perpetrator will only make the victim worse. The reason why this activity can develop is because the real victims cannot rely on ""better"" in the future for comfort. The harm to the victims is real... Justice that can be done on time cannot be pinned on the future. It is really common for people to fish in troubled waters in a group. This is the meaning of evidence and truth.",为什么个人要依靠集体的力量？因为加害者和受害者都知道，对抗加害者只会让受害者变得更糟。这种活动之所以能够开展，是因为真正的受害者不能依靠未来的“更好”来获得安慰。对受害者的伤害是真实的……能够按时伸张的正义不能寄托在未来。人们成群浑水摸鱼的情况确实很常见。这就是证据和真理的意义。

After taking up the post, it is not a PK between these two groups. As long as the basic qualities of female police officers are good, there will be no problem in coping with normal work, because frontline police officers do not face murderers every day. Interrogation and investigation are also frontline work. At this time, it is meaningless to emphasize the physical strength difference between men and women. When targeting serious criminals, male police officers do not rely on one person to do it recklessly. They need teamwork. My husband graduated from the police academy and told us that they run the same as men and women during training without special treatment. There are strong girls that ordinary boys cannot beat. If you only look at weaker girls and stronger boys, then the world in your eyes is naturally strong men and weak women.",我说过，我们不应该专注于战斗。前线警察并不是每天都在战斗。女警察只要身体素质比普通人好就可以了。审讯不算前线吗？其实你忽略了一点。警校里的打斗是男女警察之间的。上任后，这两个群体之间就不是PK了。只要女警察的基本素质好，应付正常的工作是没有问题的，因为一线警察并不是每天都面对凶手。审讯、调查也是一线工作。这个时候再强调男女的体力差异是没有意义的。在针对严重犯罪分子时，男警察不会依靠一个人肆意妄为。他们需要团队合作。老公是警校毕业的，他告诉我们，训练时跟男女跑一样，没有特殊待遇。有一些坚强的女孩是普通男孩无法击败的。如果你只看弱女孩和强男孩，那么你眼中的世界自然就是男强女弱。

The man's surname is his own surname, not his father's surname? ? The woman's last name is her father's last name? LOL.

Generally speaking, it won't be a man. If the woman wants to keep her job, she has to ask her family to help take care of the child, and then the woman and her family will be taking care of the child; or the woman gives up her job and stays at home to take care of the child for two years, then the problem arises.",而且虽然孩子是自己的，但要让家里的老人完全不干涉恐怕也很难。你必须放弃工作，在家照顾孩子，这在现实生活中是不现实的。如果婆婆真的不帮忙带孩子，就意味着在孩子两岁之前，夫妻俩中只有一人可以放弃工作，留在家里带孩子。一般来说，不会是一个男人。如果女方想保住工作，就得让家人帮忙带孩子，然后由女方和家人来带孩子；或者女方放弃工作在家带孩子两年，问题就出现了。

I hope that the final result will be fair and just, and I am waiting for the truth. I hope Fuzai will not lie down and be the simple and kind-hearted him. It is not worth it for her to have a shadow in her heart. Fuzai hit someone, and he did not escape. He did it and he will admit it. He should bear what he should bear, but he should not bear what he should not bear. Don't be Yuka Nakaura.",我不支持任何一方打人。对于已经证实的事情，她充满谎言、夸张、伪造证据、雇佣网络喷子、引领潮流、从事网络暴力。她花钱撤下了有利于福仔的热搜，又花钱删除了有利于福仔的微博和评论。希望最终的结果能够公平公正，等待真相。希望福仔不要躺着，做那个单纯善良的他。让她心里有阴影是不值得的。福哉撞到了人，他没有逃脱。他做到了，他也会承认。该承受的他该承受，不该承受的他不该承受。不要成为中浦由香。

You picked out the feminist words on my Weibo, and I only have one Weibo, so you still think I mean feminism? , then your logic is really good. Come on, I'm a man. I mentioned extreme feminism as soon as I saw it. Did I immediately think that men deserve to die? If you still think that I am a misogynist who does not engage in abstract ideas about feminism, then you and the person downstairs also have extreme feminism tendencies. As for my Weibo focusing on so many things, why do others see other things? , you are the one downstairs who says I talk about feminism, so why do you think I am antagonizing men and women? , besides, when you see the comments and likes on the debate over men’s and women’s rights, most of them are mocking men, right? After all, Weibo’s stronghold is on the female side. If you still find it interesting to troll each other every day, ezgirl, and if you want to argue with me about men’s rights and women’s rights, please go to the hater’s Weibo. Then it’s great if you see the garbage comments that someone has deprived him of the championship. I’ll start from the beginning. In the end, I just wanted to say this. As for laying eggs, I just learned about it. I thought it was a professional term in your industry. There is also the issue of his black spots, which I haven’t washed away. It’s just that it’s his character problem that he plays abstractly and creates antagonism between men and women. He used to focus on playing chess and now he’s taken the wrong path. Besides, it’s not a sinful thing to get high. ? , do you think the person who deprived him of the championship was blackmail? I casually clicked on that popular comment and went to the homepage and saw some extreme feminism, with no sign of trolling.

We don’t know what the Japanese modeling industry is like, and we have never been there. My guess is different from yours. All are inaccurate and cannot be used as a basis for trust. I don't attribute all problems to being forced, but I think your understanding of being forced is only about threats and orders. You haven't considered the pressure from the environment, what the situation was like at the time, and whether it was possible to refuse. I think everyone The cajoling, persuasion, and appeasement will inhibit rejection from actually happening. I think one reason was that she didn't refuse out of fear, and the other was because the environment she was in at the time made her feel that she shouldn't refuse. You may not understand what I'm saying. For example, someone asked me to take nude photos and I wanted to refuse, but he said it was art. It had nothing to do with my personal body, but a certain will expressed through the body, thereby brainwashing me. I just want to express that people are often afraid in that situation. You've probably never been naked and watched. Why not refuse? Never ask a victim that. Saying no takes courage, anytime. I feel that my experience is similar to hers because, first of all, we are both women and have been violated by unwanted glances in our naked state. So I think I understand that a woman can be coerced when she's naked, which is really vicious of you to say that! I don’t talk about other people’s things, I talk about myself. I was molested by relatives in the fifth grade of elementary school, and I don’t dare to tell the people around me until now! There is always a trace of luck in my heart, thinking that maybe he didn't mean to do anything, and I never dare to face the facts that make people grab their hair and scream in the middle of the night. I hate that person and I hate myself for not being able to stop him and teach him a lesson because of my upbringing and ignorance. You don’t understand at all.",我认为你和我对于是否可以做出自己的选择没有太多发言权。我们不知道日本的模特行业是什么样的，我们也没有去过那里。我的猜测与你的不同。一切都是不准确的，不能作为信任的基础。我并不把所有问题都归咎于被迫，但我认为你对被迫的理解只是威胁和命令。你没有考虑过来自环境的压力，当时的情况是什么样的，是否可以拒绝。我想大家的哄骗、劝说、安抚都会抑制拒绝的实际发生。我想原因一是她因为害怕而没有拒绝，二是因为当时所处的环境让她觉得自己不应该拒绝。你可能不明白我在说什么。比如有人让我拍裸照，我想拒绝，但他说那是艺术。它与我个人的身体无关，而是通过身体表达出某种意志，从而对我进行洗脑。我只是想表达人们在这种情况下常常感到害怕。你可能从来没有赤身裸体并被人看过。为什么不拒绝呢？永远不要问受害者这个问题。任何时候说“不”都需要勇气。我觉得我的经历和她很相似，因为，首先，我们都是女性，在赤裸的状态下都受到过不受欢迎的目光的侵犯。所以我想我明白了，女人赤身裸体是可以被胁迫的，你这样说实在是太恶毒了！我不说别人的事，只说我自己。小学五年级的时候被亲戚猥亵，到现在我都不敢告诉身边的人！心里总有一丝侥幸，心想也许他并不是有意要做什么，始终不敢面对那些让人在半夜抓着头发尖叫的事实。我恨那个人，也恨我自己，因为我的教养和无知，没能阻止他、教训他。你根本不明白。

It’s sad that these people account for 97%",时代变了，旧的婚姻法不再有效。我们的前辈为我们的自由而奋斗。在我们还比较自由的时代，我们并没有争取更多的自由。相反，我们挤在前人打开天窗的笼子里，骂着那些离开笼子的同类。现在天窗又开始慢慢关闭了。好吧，你还不知道该怪谁吗？悲哀的是这些人占了97%

63600,Rapper唱MF本来是正常的是。但宋在SMTM里唱的那句妇产科的歌词却是很不妥，甚至被扣上侮辱女性的帽子。这一次他不是提到而是强调了MF为什么我不能说，其实如果只是路人的话带着“这个人好像不太尊重女性”的想法去听都会有些反感吧。所以不是所有Rapper不能说MF而是要看你有没有被扣上侮辱女性的帽子。,0.0,3,"It is normal for rappers to sing MF. But the lyrics about obstetrics and gynecology that Song sang in SMTM were very inappropriate and were even labeled as insulting women. This time he didn't mention it but emphasized why I can't talk about MF. In fact, if you were just a passerby, you would be a little disgusted if you listened with the thought ""This person doesn't seem to respect women."" So it's not that all rappers can't say MF, but it depends on whether you have been labeled as insulting women.",说唱歌手唱MF很正常。但宋在SMTM中唱的有关妇产科的歌词却非常不恰当，甚至被贴上了侮辱女性的标签。这次他没有提，只是强调了为什么我不能谈MF。事实上，如果你只是一个路人，如果你带着“这个人似乎不尊重女性”的想法去听，你会有点反感。所以并不是所有说唱歌手都不能说MF，而是要看你有没有被贴上侮辱女性的标签。

The more brutal murderers would kill everyone they saw, regardless of gender. Foreign mass murder cases involving gunmen are generally indiscriminate attacks, and the suspects are suppressed with absolute force.",会不会，在中国持枪是违法的，所以犯罪嫌疑人大多用刀伤人，而且目标多是体弱的妇女和小孩子。 。 。更残忍的凶手会杀死他们看到的所有人，无论性别。国外涉及枪手的大规模杀人案件一般都是不分青红皂白的袭击，对犯罪嫌疑人进行绝对的武力镇压。

63610,"我本就与所有强奸犯仇女分子割席，这种人即使只是有想法都会被清除出我的所有圈子，工作上也不会允许自己和这种人有任何交集,理想和标签是两码事好嘛，如果你尊重女性，有着希望女性能够独立且自由的人生，就不可能漠视别人假借维护女性之名，发表着侮辱女性的言论，做着侮辱女性的事情,默许别人用方代表自己追求的完美的圆的行为，往小了说叫劣币驱逐良币，往大了说叫“平庸之恶”，不说清理门户，至少要积极割席，勇敢斗争，而不是就因为大家都喜欢的是所谓的圆，就漠视他人实际拿着的是个方的恶行,所以你觉得法律去制裁强奸犯杀人犯，社会去批判抽女者，只是因为他们做的恶吗？更是为了剥夺他们代表正常人类的权利。至于偏激，就像罗翔说的，确实很难画一个完美的圆，那难道就代表完美的圆不存在？那如果真的追求完美的圆，又怎么能忍受别人把方说成圆，让别人用方来代表圆呢？",0.0,3,"I have already cut ties with all rapists and misogynists. Such people will be removed from all my circles even if they just have an idea. I will not allow myself to have any intersection with such people at work. Ideals and labels are two different things. If you respect women and hope that women can live an independent and free life, you cannot ignore others who make insulting remarks and do insulting things in the name of protecting women. You can acquiesce in others using squares to represent the perfect circle you pursue. In a small sense, it is called bad money driving out good money, and in a big sense, it is called ""the banality of evil"". If you don't say clean up the door, at least you should actively cut ties and fight bravely, instead of ignoring the evil deeds of others who actually hold a square just because everyone likes the so-called circle. So do you think that the law punishes rapists and murderers, and society criticizes those who beat women, just because they do evil? It is also to deprive them of the right to represent normal human beings. As for extremism, as Luo Xiang said, it is indeed difficult to draw a perfect circle. Does that mean that a perfect circle does not exist? If you really pursue a perfect circle, how can you tolerate others calling a square a circle and letting others use a square to represent a circle?",我已经与所有强奸犯和厌恶女性的人断绝关系。这样的人，哪怕只是有一个想法，也会被我从所有圈子里剔除。我不会允许自己在工作中与这样的人有任何的交集。理想和标签是两个不同的东西。如果你尊重女性，希望女性能够过上独立、自由的生活，就不能忽视那些以保护女性为名发表侮辱性言论、做出侮辱性事情的人。你可以默认别人用正方形来代表你追求的完美圆形。狭义上叫劣币驱逐良币，广义上叫“恶之平庸”。如果不说清理门，至少应该主动断绝关系，勇敢斗争，而不是因为大家都喜欢所谓的圆，而忽视其他实际上抱方的恶行。那么你认为法律惩罚强奸犯和杀人犯，社会批评那些殴打妇女的人，只是因为他们做了坏事吗？也是剥夺他们代表正常人的权利。至于极端主义，正如罗翔所说，确实很难画一个完美的圆。这是否意味着完美的圆不存在？如果你真的追求完美的圆，你怎么能容忍别人称方为圆，让别人用方来代表圆呢？

There is a difference between bitch and naughty...a derogatory meaning that has been used since birth is different from the derogatory meaning that only comes from a certain background...You know very well that this is a derogatory meaning in a patriarchal background, so if you are not misogynistic, do you need to break away from this background and re-understand it? Or give it something new? , I didn’t express it clearly. What I mean is that the meaning now has a derogatory meaning.

64039,掺和一下好有意思哦。他反对的是极端女权吗？仔细看他的原话和后来怼人的话，再看看捧他的人关注伐木工都能知道是什么样子。全篇阴阳怪气，被怼了就说玩梗别人开不起玩笑，这种人放在现实无论性别你会喜欢吗？哦我忘记了，毕竟上次说女裁判影响比赛精彩程度的事整场闹那么大，你们还继续维护着某人呢。,0.0,3,"It's interesting to get involved. Is he against extreme feminism? Look carefully at his original words and his later insults, and then look at the people who support him and follow Lumberjack to know what he is like. The whole article is sarcastic, and when he is insulted, he says that others can't take jokes. Would you like such a person in real life regardless of gender? Oh, I forgot, after all, the last time he said that the female referee affected the excitement of the game, the whole game was so fussy, and you still continued to defend someone.",插嘴很有意思，他是反对极端女权主义的吗？仔细看他原话和后来的辱骂，再看看支持他、关注Lumberjack的人就知道他是什么样的人了。整篇文章都是讽刺，被辱骂的时候还说别人开不起玩笑。现实生活中你会喜欢这样的人，不管男女？哦，我忘了，毕竟上次他说女裁判影响比赛热闹，整场比赛都这么闹腾，你还继续为某人辩护。
64040,忘了说图1.2和我对话的另一主人公是身边曾如此亲近之人。也许有人觉得支持女权与否只是三观问题 但越了解女权我越发现这是根上的问题 会渗透在这个人生活中包括言行举止的方方面面。毕竟如果留意一下就会发现生活中被性别视角所渗透着的问题无处不在。但也肯定不强求谁赞同谁互不赞同一拍两散就好了。,0.0,3,"I forgot to mention that the other protagonist I was talking to in Figure 1.2 was someone I had been so close to. Some people may think that whether or not they support women's rights is just a matter of perspective. But the more I understand women's rights, the more I realize that this is a fundamental issue that will permeate every aspect of a person's life, including their words and deeds. After all, if you pay attention, you will find that problems permeated by the gender perspective are everywhere in life. But I certainly don’t force anyone to agree and disagree with each other and just break up.",我忘了提及图 1.2 中与我交谈的另一位主角是我非常亲近的人。有些人可能认为是否支持女权只是一个观点问题。但我越了解妇女权利，我就越意识到这是一个根本问题，将渗透到一个人生活的方方面面，包括他们的言行。毕竟，只要你留心，就会发现生活中到处都是性别视角渗透的问题。但我当然不会强迫任何人同意或不同意对方然后就分手。

64048,"去看看欧美和这里的区别就知道。含沙射影，有本事直接爆名字。而且韩国的偶像anti多啊，偶像这种也没啥利益搭嘎了，难道不应该直接报警。,韩国的状态本来就和欧美不一样，我觉得那里的利益交换更多。女性地位更差",0.0,3,"Just look at the difference between Europe and America and here. Insinuations, and the ability to directly reveal names. Moreover, there are a lot of idol protests in Korea. Idols don’t have much to gain from it. Shouldn’t they call the police directly? The situation in South Korea is inherently different from that in Europe and the United States. I think there is more exchange of interests there. Women's status is worse",看看欧美和这里的区别就知道了。影射，以及直接透露名字的能力。而且，韩国的偶像抗议活动也不少。偶像并没有从中得到太多好处。难道不应该直接报警吗？韩国的情况与欧美有着本质上的不同。我认为那里有更多的利益交流。女性地位更差

64051,嗯，原po提的这几个点我也是觉得看得很难受，但反过来想想是不是编剧故意这样写的呢？好像目前我们这个社会真的是这样？太多人并没有隐私权的意识，包括一些心理医生。,0.0,3,"Well, I also found these points mentioned in the original post very uncomfortable, but on the other hand, if I think about it, did the screenwriter write it this way on purpose?

64053,"可是社会在很多方面对女性就是歧视的。如果单是考虑能力就好了,补充一下，社会不是“有点儿”弱肉强食，是非常弱肉强食噢。但是社会存在的就一定是正确的吗？索性不要搞女权了，毕竟在这个社会不是主流，吃不开的,当然你对原po性格的分析不无道理。好奇问一句，你认为社会能够给她提供的历练和打磨是什么呢～,试着从原po的角度思考一下吧。1，她刚刚结婚的时候并没有接触「女权」所以不可能找个云南贵州老公。2，她介意冠姓的问题。3，对女性来说生育并不是一件简单的事情。,生养小孩很辛苦的，“想要冠姓权可以再生一个”，这样说未免有点太轻巧了吧",0.0,3,"But society discriminates against women in many aspects. If we only consider ability, it would be fine. Let me add that society is not ""a little bit"" the law of the jungle, it is very much the law of the jungle. But is everything that exists in society necessarily right? Just don't engage in feminism. After all, you won't be popular in this society if you are not mainstream. Of course, your analysis of the original poster's personality is not unreasonable. I'm curious, what kind of experience and polishing do you think society can provide her~, try to think about it from the original poster's perspective. 1. When she just got married, she hadn't been exposed to ""feminism"" so it was impossible for her to find a husband from Yunnan or Guizhou. 2. She minds the issue of the surname. 3. Giving birth is not a simple matter for women. Raising children is very hard. ""If you want the right to pass on your surname, you can have another one."" This is a bit too light.",但社会在很多方面都存在对女性的歧视。如果只考虑能力，那还好。我要补充一点，社会不是“一点点”丛林法则，而是非常弱肉强食。但社会上存在的一切就一定是对的吗？只是不要参与女权主义。毕竟，如果你不主流，你在这个社会就不会受欢迎。当然，你对原发者性格的分析也不无道理。我很好奇，你认为社会能给她什么样的体验和打磨~，尝试从原贴者的角度思考一下。 1、刚结婚的时候，她还没有接触过“女权主义”，所以不可能找到云南、贵州的老公。 2.她介意姓氏问题。 3、生孩子对于女性来说并不是一件简单的事情。养育孩子是非常辛苦的。 “如果你想要继承姓氏的权利，你可以再拥有一个。”这有点太轻了。

64062,本来大家好好地就事论事，结果某某日记一出，就来了左右，还极左极右——就连70后也是不懂这两个称号啊，因为基本没接触过——从这一点上说，某某日记就是在发帽子在撕裂,0.0,3,"At first, everyone was discussing the matter in a good manner, but as soon as so-and-so’s diary came out, people started to criticize them, and they were even extreme left and right.

From this point of view, , so-and-so’s diary is just posting and tearing the hat",一开始大家都还好好地讨论着这件事，但是某某的日记一出来，人们就开始批评他们，甚至极左极右。就连20世纪70年代的人也不太理解这两个标题，因为他们基本上没有接触过。从这一点来看，某某的日记只是发帖撕帽子而已

64064,这个感觉地区更加明显，去某地的时候，大家会肤浅的看打扮，并没有人会生气，甚至去代购城买衣服时，别人会看着装而区别对待,0.0,3,"This feeling is more obvious in other regions. When you go to a certain place, people will superficially look at your appearance, and no one will get angry. Even when you go to a shopping mall to buy clothes, people will treat you differently based on your appearance.",这种感觉在其他地区更为明显。当你去某个地方时，人们只会粗浅地看你的外表，没有人会生气。即使你去商场买衣服，人们也会根据你的外表对你区别对待。

It is because women have to have children and capitalists are unwilling to share this social cost, sisters? Are you serious? Equal pay for equal work? Go to a job fair and see how many are gender-restrictive? We have not had equal pay for equal work since the beginning, and the channels for advancement are also very narrow. The probability of collective discrimination is not high? Racism is collective enough, right? Did not happen? Doesn't it matter if it's none of your business? When an avalanche occurs, no snowflake is innocent. Sisters, why do you want to have a girl? Most people will answer you because there is less pressure. Why is there less pressure?

People who are married around me will say that if you get pregnant, give birth to a boy. If you give birth to a boy, you don’t need to have another baby.

What is the male to female birth ratio?

What you may face may include the whole crew flying to the next place, leaving you alone, smearing you, blocking your career, etc. Eva Green was so popular back then, but she couldn't stand up to Weinstein's revenge. I think we should have more sympathy for them instead of being harsh. Are the ""hidden rules"" based on unequal power relationships really consensual?

How is it such a coincidence? , even though it was not banned on the hot search, Eun He was probably stupid enough to look for comments elsewhere after seeing his hot search. Even if I want to say something, I will forward it and say it. It has always been like this. , Eun He did not comment elsewhere, and left her alone mute. It is too similar to the ban operation of a certain account that Xiao Zhan Liufengche used before. Mad Dog and Xiao Zhan have to fight for hundreds of rounds in a war like Windmill, so I think Eun He is being irrational now. ,Too. But Enhe mentioned one sentence on her own Weibo, and the rest came from her comments. Without Papi's buy-out draft, this matter would not have gone out of business at all. Maybe Enhe’s next Weibo will be about other things. I don't agree with what Enhe is doing now, and I can't fight to the death. In other words, feuding with each other is not very effective. But it’s true that Papi did those things... That night, I looked at four or five drafts, and the time was about the same. Popular searches on Baidu are earlier than hot searches on Weibo. Talk about hot searches online, and make another hot search for Enhe. Later, the account was blocked and banned, and I left a hot search of my own. Really, the operation is the same as Xiao Zhan's. I thought this incident would just go away. If I hadn’t seen it here, my wife, I wouldn’t have known that Enhe couldn’t swallow it, so I don’t know what she thought.",那么我也相信427是肖战干的，但是没有人能直接证明是他干的。不多说了，继续相信你papi酱的纯真和纯洁。 ，我以前从来没有听说过恩花被列入黑名单。然后还有15个人炸了账号。恩和被封后，Papi热搜仍在继续。怎么会这么巧呢？虽然没有被封禁上热搜，但恩赫看到他的热搜后，大概是傻到去别处找评论了。即使我想说些什么，我也会转发并说出来。一直都是这样。 ，恩赫没有在其他地方发表评论，留下她一个人默不作声。和肖战流风车之前使用的某个账号的封禁操作太像了。疯狗和肖战必须在风车这样的战争中打上百回合，所以我认为恩赫现在不理智了。 ，也。但恩和在自己的微博上提到了一句话，其余的都来自她的评论。如果没有Papi的买断稿，这件事根本就不会不了了之。也许恩和的下一条微博会是关于其他事情的。我不同意恩和现在的做法，我也不能拼死一战。换句话说，互相争斗的效果并不大。不过Papi确实做过那些事……那天晚上，我看了四五稿，时间都差不多。百度热搜早于微博热搜。谈网上热搜，恩和再上一次热搜。后来账号被封禁，还留下了自己的热搜。真的，操作和肖战是一样的。我以为这件事就这么过去了。如果不是看到这里，老婆，我根本不知道恩和不能咽下去，所以我不知道她是怎么想的。

The advantage of Weibo is that it allows us to understand the world. I may not be able to change the world, but I hope that after understanding the events happening around us, we can work hard not to let the world change. , this kind of thing is not reported by everyone. The Bangzi media is separate from the government and is not subject to government supervision? That’s why South Korea reveals many truths through news and columns. Most news in China is censored. This is a national political distinction. National conditions are different. Have you ever seen any domestic program that can directly expose scandals on the program without passing state review?",说实话，我不太明白你想表达什么，可能是因为年龄的差距。微博的功能是让人们讨论事件并表达自己的观点。与其别人说什么，不如站出来说你有能力改变世界。微博的好处在于它可以让我们了解世界。我或许无法改变世界，但我希望在了解了身边发生的事件之后，我们可以努力不让世界改变。 ，这种事可不是大家都报道的。梆子媒体与政府分离，不受政府监管？这就是为什么韩国通过新闻和专栏揭露许多真相。中国的大多数新闻都受到审查。这是国家政治的区别。国情不同。你见过国内有哪个节目可以在不通过国家审核的情况下直接揭露节目丑闻的吗？

64611,我觉得主要还是自由主张过度、分不清界限吧，原创小说或许就没人撕，同人撕少一点，而写真人被撕在我看来一点都不奇怪，自己写真人明星不允许别人举报，但如果有人写她自己的黄文她肯定要举报。当然举报的正当性是值得探讨的，不一定全对也不一定全错，我觉得很多人说“举报是蛆”是在跟风,0.0,3,"I think the main reason is that the freedom is too much and the boundaries are not clear. Original novels may not be ripped off, and fans may be ripped off less. However, it is not strange at all for me to be ripped off when writing about real people. I don’t allow others to report when I write about real celebrities. But if someone writes porn about herself, she will definitely report it. Of course, the legitimacy of reporting is worth discussing. It is not necessarily right or wrong. I think many people who say ""reporting is maggots"" are just following the trend.",我觉得最主要的原因是自由太多，界限不清晰。原创小说可能不会被坑，粉丝被坑的可能会少一些。不过，对于我来说，写真实人物时被骗一点也不奇怪。当我写真正的名人时，我不允许别人举报。但如果有人写自己的色情作品，她肯定会举报。当然，报道的合法性值得商榷。这不一定是对的，也不一定是错的。我想很多说“报道都是蛆虫”的人只是跟风而已。

The vast majority of states allow abortion before 20 weeks. The extremes of the right now come from the extremes of the left. Half of the children can be aborted if the mother does not want them. In comparison, it is still humane to not endanger the mother's health and not allow abortion.",你当然有权利，但为什么非要等到大月呢？绝大多数州允许 20 周前堕胎。现在右派的极端来自左派的极端。如果母亲不想要，一半的孩子可以流产。相比之下，在不危害母亲健康、不允许堕胎的情况下，还是人道的。

64639,这种情况——第一，胎儿权利和母亲权利之间的权衡，要求母亲承担一定的举证责任。例如你如果怀孕8个月之后，忽然宣称自己是被强奸的，要求堕胎——这种情况下要求你承担必要的举证责任，不为过吧？第二，即使母亲可以堕胎，父亲仍然需要被惩罚，两者并非排他性的关系。,0.0,3,"In this case, first, the balance between the rights of the fetus and the rights of the mother requires the mother to bear a certain burden of proof.

64738,"重新思考，可能还有就是在我这里爱情反而是……摆不上台面的,不过搞cp的时候这些东西仅限二次元啊，我恐三次元男性包括异性恋同性恋，我都恐，对三次元兄弟情深无感，真的不比任何东西高贵，放到二次元的话我这里兄弟情>爱情，所以说次元差真的很大,还有很多东西，我自己很清楚我的这德行，像搞cp的时候，我那一套我本命必不能作受是很明显的男尊思想产物，太明显了，还有像当受是委屈，都是,我脑内有很传统的一套男女观念，然而当这用在我自己身上时又会使我感到极端不适，所以我去寻求所谓的平权，但我本质里还是用着那一套很传统的男女观念，男人赚钱女人养家，生儿育女，不能露出点多余的皮肤，不能怎么怎么，我真是这样的，说起来还真是讽刺,虽然我高中一度说着男性能做的女性也能，对一切不平等的看待非常不满，但实际上这种情况只是因为我不是男性而已。这个想法是以男性是上层阶级，而女性是下层阶级为底层建筑的，若我不是弱势方我怎么可能会去争取“平权”呢？哈",0.0,3,"Rethink, maybe there is also the fact that love here is... not on the table, but when doing CP, these things are only limited to the second dimension. I am afraid of three-dimensional men, including straight and gay men, and I am afraid of the third dimension. Brotherhood in the Yuan Dynasty is deeply indifferent and is really no nobler than anything else. If we put it in the second dimension, I would consider brotherhood > love, so the dimensional difference is really big, and there are many things. I am very aware of my virtues, like When I was doing CP, my idea that I was destined not to suffer was an obvious product of male-dominated thinking. It was too obvious. There was also the idea that suffering was a grievance. I had a very traditional set of ideas about men and women in my mind. , however, when this is applied to myself, it makes me feel extremely uncomfortable, so I seek so-called equal rights, but in my essence I still use the very traditional concept of men and women. Men make money, women support the family, and have children. Women, you can't show any extra skin, you can't do anything. I'm really like this. It's really ironic to say that. Although I once said in high school that women can do what men can do, I was very dissatisfied with all the unequal treatment, but in fact This situation is simply because I am not a male. This idea is based on the idea that men are the upper class and women are the lower class. If I am not a disadvantaged party, how can I fight for ""equal rights""? ha",转念一想，也许还有一个事实，这里的爱情……不是摆在台面上的，但是做CP的时候，这些东西就只限于二次元了。我害怕三维的男人，包括直男和男同性恋，我害怕三维。元朝的兄弟情谊是深沉冷漠的，实在不比什么高尚。如果放在二次元的话，我会认为兄弟情>爱情，所以空间差异真的很大，东西也很多。我很清楚自己的优点，比如我在做CP的时候，我认为我注定不会受苦，这显然是男性主导思想的产物。这太明显了。还有人认为苦难是一种委屈。我心里对男人和女人有一套非常传统的观念。然而，当这运用到我自己身上时，就让我感到极其不舒服，所以我寻求所谓的平等权利，但本质上我仍然使用非常传统的男女观念。男人赚钱，女人养家，生孩子。女人，你不能露出多余的皮肤，你什么也做不了。我真的就是这样的。说起来实在是太讽刺了。虽然我在高中的时候曾经说过，男人能做的事情，女人也能做，对一切不平等的待遇我都非常不满，但事实上，这种情况只是因为我不是男性。这个想法是基于男性是上层阶级、女性是下层阶级的观念。如果我不是弱势群体，我怎么去争取“平权”呢？哈

Don't incite negative emotions.",如果你是受雇说这句话，在微博上败坏孩子们，你不觉得愧疚吗？你是精神病还是你有工资？为什么你的微博帖子和评论每天都那么暴力？你能告诉我一点吗？我从来没有骂过人，你却一直骂我。我是平心静气地和你讲道理，只是讲事实。我身边经常骑摩托车上山的女孩，开车技术也很好。这是个人才能的问题，而不是性别问题。兄弟，你看，你正在制造性别鸿沟。这是错误的。微博上的大部分人都是孩子。不要败坏他们的思想。没有绝对的。请不要一概而论，也不要制造性别鸿沟。微博已经乱了。不要煽动负面情绪。

64885,你说的挺对的，而且如果有一个人姓氏不好听，也可以跟着另一方姓呀。日本还有夫妇同姓，意思是结婚了女性加入男性的家庭，男性把自己宝贵的姓氏给予女性。有感情就行了，也没必要这么在意形式,0.0,3,"You are quite right, and if one person's last name is not pleasant, you can also take the other person's last name. In Japan, couples also share the same surname, which means that after marriage, the woman joins the man's family, and the man gives his precious surname to the woman. As long as you have feelings, there is no need to care so much about form.",你说得对，如果一个人的姓氏不好听，你也可以取另一个人的姓氏。在日本，夫妻也同姓，这意味着结婚后女方加入男方家庭，男方将自己珍贵的姓氏赋予女方。只要有感情，就没必要太在意形式。

Why should I pay attention to issues that others think I ""should"" pay attention to? Isn't this moral kidnapping? Please don't kidnap me under my Weibo. And I'm not against men and women, OK? Didn't you see that I was talking about trolls, I didn't refer to them in general, okay?",难道女性问题不应该得到重视吗？为什么我要关注别人认为我“应该”关注的问题？这不是道德绑架吗？请不要在我的微博下绑架我。我并不反对男人和女人，好吗？你没看到我在谈论巨魔吗，我不是泛指他们，好吗？
64899,"我倒是了解过以后才张嘴的，很显然你没有，只听说了点模模糊糊的就张嘴了。,说得巴拉巴拉，还以为你多了解呢。“国内警察不配抢”？你哥不配抢不代表别人不配枪。跟踪、蹲点女人不行吗？又不是不会走路。网上规范用辣椒水的新闻一大堆，你看不到吗？并不是任何时候就直接掏枪的。你要不还是脑子撸顺了再出来讲话吧，语句都不顺，别丢你哥的人了。",0.0,3,"I didn't open my mouth until I understood it.

There are a lot of news on the Internet about regulating the use of chili pepper water, can’t you see it? It's not like he just pulls out his gun at any time. Why don't you come out and speak after your brain is straightened out? Your sentences are not smooth, so don't embarrass your brother.",直到我明白了，我才开口。显然你没有。你只听到了一些模糊的声音，张开了嘴。 ，没错，巴拉巴拉，我还以为你更了解呢。 “国内警察不配抢劫”？仅仅因为你的兄弟不值得拥有枪并不意味着其他人不值得拥有枪。跟踪和跟踪女人不是可以吗？他又不是不能走路。网上有很多关于规范辣椒水使用的新闻，你看不到吗？他又不是随时都会拔出枪的。脑子理清楚之后为什么不出来说话呢？你的句子不流畅，别让你弟弟为难了。

64901,"还有你说的“这个标准不应该由公权力掌握”，哪怕是具体诉讼案负责审判的法官代表的也是公权力啊，因为公权力被共同认可。,“诽谤类案件”和商标“败坏道德、有诽谤性”是不一样的，后者是立法者考量到公序良俗制定的标准，而前者是具体针对个人或群体的个案。我认为问题核心在于“如何界定商标是否败坏道德和具有诽谤性”，商标注册肯定需要有限制，不然“Fascism万岁”或“911万岁”等博关注的内容会造成二次伤害。,所以一定要受害者出现，某些群体被冒犯之后才禁止吗？",0.0,3,"And what you said, ""This standard should not be controlled by public power."" Even the judge who is responsible for the trial of a specific lawsuit represents public power, because public power is jointly recognized. , ""Defamation cases"" are different from trademarks that ""corrupt morals and are defamatory"". The latter is a standard set by legislators taking into account public order and good morals, while the former is a case specifically targeted at an individual or group. I think the core of the problem lies in ""how to define whether a trademark is morally corrupt and defamatory."" There must be restrictions on trademark registration, otherwise attention-grabbing content such as ""Long live Fascism"" or ""Long live 9/11"" will cause secondary harm. , so the victim must appear and certain groups are offended before it is banned?",还有你说的“这个标准不应该受公共权力的控制”。即使是负责审理具体诉讼的法官也代表着公共权力，因为公共权力是共同承认的。 、“诽谤案”与“败坏道德、具有诽谤性”的商标不同。后者是立法者考虑公共秩序和良好道德而制定的标准，而前者是专门针对个人或群体的案件。我认为问题的核心在于“如何界定商标是否道德败坏、是否具有诽谤性”。商标注册必须有限制，否则诸如“法西斯主义万岁”或“9/11万岁”等引人注目的内容会造成二次伤害。 ，所以必须有受害者出现并且得罪了某些群体才被封禁？
64902,这个词在我看来就跟“田园女权”似的，只要使用就极有可能扣帽子和造成刻板印象，极有可能切断沟通的可能，还是不要用比较好。,0.0,3,"In my opinion, this word is similar to ""pastoral feminism"". As long as it is used, it is very likely to be labeled and stereotyped, and it is very likely to cut off the possibility of communication. It is better not to use it.",在我看来，这个词与“田园女权主义”类似。只要用了，就很有可能被贴上标签、刻板印象，很有可能就断绝了沟通的可能性。最好不要使用它。

64907,一切的前提还是如果法律真的有用。毕竟几乎所有的报警都是不了了之，就算有证据也被权力截断了。不管怎么说舆论也只是一群绝望的人最后的方式了吧，现在说出来就算是报复心理也是合情合理的，但如果放弃机会继续沉默以后多半是没有这样的机会了，而受害者只能一辈子痛苦。,0.0,3,"The premise of everything is if the law is really useful. After all, almost all calls to the police go unanswered, and even if there is evidence, it is cut off by the authorities. In any case, public opinion is just the last resort for a group of desperate people. It is reasonable to speak out now even if it is vindictive, but if you give up the opportunity and continue to remain silent, there will probably be no such opportunity in the future, and the victim will only suffer for the rest of his life.",一切的前提是法律是否真的有用。毕竟，几乎所有报警电话都无人接听，即使有证据，也被当局切断。无论如何，舆论只是一群走投无路的人的最后手段。现在说出来就算是怀恨在心也是情理之中，但如果放弃机会，继续保持沉默，以后很可能就没有这样的机会了，受害者也只能受苦一生。

How can people feel at ease? If this movement does not proceed, the law will always be like that (after all, there were still many sexual assaults before public opinion was generated on the Internet. I haven’t seen any major improvements. Why are sexual assaults so common? Isn't the low cost of crime one of the reasons why things are so widespread?",但即使淫秽证据充足，也只是拘留7天而已。怎样才能让人们安心呢？如果这个运动不进行下去，法律就永远是这样（毕竟在网络舆论产生之前，性侵事件还是有很多的，我还没看到有什么大的改进，为什么性侵这么普遍呢？犯罪成本低难道不是犯罪如此普遍的原因之一吗？
64920,同性恋和异性恋就像一个人喜欢吃苹果，一个人不喜欢吃苹果，总不会有人因为不喜欢吃苹果而歧视吧？同样的道理放在同性恋和异性恋身上怎么就不行了呢？归根结底不过是历史遗留下来的传统观念束缚了思想。,0.0,3,"Homosexuality and heterosexuality are just like one person likes to eat apples and one person doesn't like to eat apples. No one will discriminate because he doesn't like to eat apples, right? Why can't the same principle apply to homosexuals and heterosexuals?

When I replied to the blogger, I also said that the expression was a bit wrong. Is there something wrong with my sister’s quality? ? When you don't know both parties involved, you only question the one who was disturbed. What kind of logic is this? I don't want to discuss with you whether my sister has any qualities.

This benefit is actually not small. In the end, opposing parties register insulting trademarks against each other, which can easily deepen ethnic conflicts, but it may also just deepen performance art.",我觉得经过这个案子，法律对于这类事件的界限放宽了很多，比如暗地里涉及宗教侮辱，或者涉及对异性的侮辱。特别是，我们不排除有些人为了迎合某个群体（反MSL、反黑人、反保守派）而注册相关商标的可能性。这个好处其实不小。最后对立的双方互相注册侮辱性的商标，很容易加深族群矛盾，但也可能只是加深行为艺术。

If you ask people why they smoke without replying for no reason, why don’t you just say that you are stressed or your mouth is itchy and you want to have one?",不，抽烟喝酒都是成年人只要愿意就可以做的事情。心胸开阔了，想抽烟的人和不敢抽烟的人自然就会增多。事实上，牧区妇女的权利仍然是少数。微博上怎么会有这么多？如果你问别人为什么抽烟，却没有无缘无故地回答，你为什么不直接说你压力大或者嘴痒想抽一根呢？

You are assuming that these people don't want to have children and using this as a selling point. This is really illogical and unfounded. Regardless of whether they want to have children or not, the harm caused by reproductive rights is an objective fact. Can the negative impact on women's bodies be erased if both husband and wife are willing to have children? I think women's rights can be summed up in one sentence: equal rights and obligations. One of the inequalities comes from reproductive rights. Does your gender exchange include the exchange of reproductive rights? Well, I think the host may not have made it clear what the family situation is like in a few words, so it is difficult to judge too much. How should I put it? However, the physical impact of childbirth on women and the hard work of women in raising children are all things that men cannot understand. So you can understand that women's obligations have increased. Then, if rights and obligations are equal, should rights also increase? One of them is to convert it into economic compensation rights.",您认为为什么要求生育权补偿的人是在出卖生育权？您假设这些人不想生孩子，并以此作为卖点。这实在是不合逻辑、毫无根据。无论是否想要孩子，生育权带来的危害都是客观事实。如果夫妻双方都愿意生孩子，对女性身体的负面影响就能消除吗？我认为妇女的权利可以用一句话来概括：权利和义务平等。不平等之一来自生殖权利。你们的性别交换包括生育权的交换吗？嗯，我想楼主可能没有三言两语说清楚家庭情况是怎样的，所以很难过多的判断。我该怎么说呢？然而，生育对女性身体的影响，以及女性养育孩子的辛苦，都是男人无法理解的。所以你可以理解女性的义务增加了。那么，如果权利和义务相等，权利是否也应该增加呢？其中之一就是将其转化为经济补偿权。

After all, I am not a native speaker, so I don’t remember the ridicule towards the heroine (it’s not that it didn’t exist, or I wasn’t good enough and didn’t notice it). After seeing the ending, I felt very comfortable and breathed a sigh of relief. The male protagonist also has his own weaknesses, and whether it is the male protagonist or the male supporting character, the author doesn't like them much. Doesn't dying like a dog just mean that the world is impermanent and he himself is insignificant? Moreover, the heroine's ending is also from the author's point of view, but her parents just treat her as a wallflower and want to find someone to sell her to at a higher bid. How could her upbringing environment be any different? Just a little bit of instinctive rebellion has made her different. After experiencing the world, she learned more about the world and herself, and grew up. Wasn't the initial description of her the same as the men the heroine had met, and it became a foreshadowing in her life, and instead gave her final transformation more real weight? , but I felt different when watching ""The Veil"". Although the heroine is vain, she has experienced the world and finally became calm. What I like the most is the ending: these men have become a passing cloud, as if they are just flowers and mud on the road of her life, just to make her truly mature and confident. And she has never had to bear any moral shackles because of cheating. Although I'm a little sorry for her ending with the male protagonist, I really like this woman who only loves herself",我看了英文版。毕竟我不是母语，所以不记得对女主角的嘲讽（不是不存在，或者是我水平不够没注意到）。看到结局后，我心里很舒服，松了一口气。男主也有自己的弱点，无论是男主还是男配，作者都不太喜欢。像狗一样死去，不就说明世界无常，自己也微不足道吗？而且，女主角的结局也是从作者的角度来看的，但她的父母只是把她当作壁花，想找人高价卖给她。她的成长环境怎么可能有什么不同呢？只是一点点本能的叛逆，就让她变得与众不同。经历了这个世界，她更加了解这个世界，更加了解自己，也成长了。最初对她的描述不就是和女主角遇到的男人一样，成为她人生的伏笔，反而让她最后的转变更有真实的分量吗？但看《面纱》的时候却有不一样的感觉。女主虽然虚荣，但经历过世事，终于变得平静。我最喜欢的是结局：这些男人都成了过眼云烟，仿佛只是她人生路上的花朵和泥土，只为了让她真正成熟和自信。而她也从来没有因为出轨而承受过任何道德的枷锁。虽然有点遗憾她和男主的结局，但我真的很喜欢这个只爱自己的女人
